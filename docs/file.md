# The file package - Shared modules for template-based document generation

This is how the file generation from a yWriter project is generally done:
The write method runs through all chapters, scenes, and world building 
elements, such as characters, locations ans items, and fills templates. 

The package's [README](https://github.com/peter88213/PyWriter/tree/master/src/pywriter/file#readme) file contains a list of templates and placeholders.

## Modules
 
- **file_export** -- Provide a generic class for template-based file export.
