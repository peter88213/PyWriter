# The file package - Write documents template based

This package contains modules for template-based file processing.

This is how the file generation from a yWriter project is generally done:
The write method runs through all chapters, scenes, and world building 
elements, such as characters, locations ans items, and fills templates. 

The package's [README](https://github.com/peter88213/PyWriter/tree/master/src/pywriter/file#readme) file contains a list of templates and placeholders.
