		<SceneContent><![CDATA[The star cluster R136 in the Tarantula Nebula. On the bridge of Her Majesty's ship Atalanta, Commander Hamilton-Blossop stirred his tea and stared blankly into the clouds of ionized hydrogen that were gathering in the distance.
"Nice day today, sir," remarked Lieutenant Pinewood, the Executive Officer.
"Indeed, Mr. Pinewood," replied Commander Hamilton-Blossop. "The hydrogen clouds are still a few light-years away."
"I'd say the weather holds, sir," said Lieutenant Pinewood, sipping his teacup.
"You may be right, Mr. Pinewood. Have we actually received the latest rugby scores yet?"
A whistle sounded.
"Radar to bridge. Unidentified vessel off the starboard bow, sir. Bearing two-five-zero. Approaching fast."
Commander Hamilton-Blossop gloomily pressed the talk button on the bridge microphone.
"Not now. We're at tea."
"Yes, sir," was the answer. "Excuse me, sir."
"Can you believe it," said Commander Hamilton-Blossop, "you go two months on special assignment without seeing a single ship, and then you're interrupted at tea, of all times."
"All sorts, sir," Lieutenant Pinewood agreed, and took another sip.
There was the whistle again.
"Radio station to bridge. The alien ship is not making itself known, sir."
Commander Hamilton-Blossop sighed. "Looks like we won't be having our tea today, eh, Mr. Pinewood?"
"Would you like me to command Clear Ship, sir?"
"Good idea, Mr. Pinewood. Wanna teach the stranger a lesson in courtesy, huh?"
"Yes, sir. I'll also have the guards at the ship's vault doubled, sir."
"Splendid idea, Mr. Pinewood, by Jove! Keep an eye on the ship's vault at all costs. The welfare of the free universe depends upon the success of our mission. Never forget that, Mr. Pinewood. And now, I'd like to get the rugby scores.
There was a flash of lightning outside. The lights on the bridge flickered and went out.
"Sir! The helm doesn't respond!" the helmsman's voice echoed from the darkness.
"Damn it, Lazenby, don't be a fool! Switch to emergency systems!" growled the XO.
"Emergency systems are out, sir," reported Sailor Lazenby.
"I can't believe it," said the commander. "Sloppiness."
"Certainly, sir," replied Lieutenant Pinewood. "I shall have the guilty ones punished."
The command bridge was illuminated only by the light of the distant hydrogen nebula. And now a vast shadow was cast over it, darkening everything.
"The alien ship, sir," assumed Lieutenant Pinewood.
"I guess that's it, Mr. Pinewood. Are we cleared for action?"
"Sir, the doors won't open!" was the sound of an agitated voice.
"How could they, with the power out," the XO replied angrily. "Use your head, sailor!"
"Yes, sir! What should we do, sir?"
A violent blow shook the Atalanta to its rearmost ribs. Gravity disappeared. Commander Hamilton-Blossop felt himself floating.
Another blow sounded, then an ugly whistling and whistling.
"Leak in the ship!" someone yelled, "We're losing air!"
"Who was that? Bosun, take this man down!"
"Sorry, sir, we're losing air, sir."
"Keep your fucking composure, man. God save the Queen!"
"God save the Queen!"]]></SceneContent>

For half a year he had been trying to arrange the rendezvous, and every time something had come up. Sometimes an urgent job had to be done, sometimes Clara had a migraine or it was a summer sale -- it was like jinxed. But there it was, the big day: Captain Conner had lowered all the shutters, unplugged the phone and lit candles. Affordable sparkling wine was bubbling in the glasses, and the stereo was playing tender music by Joe Cocker and the Spaniels.
"Take it easy, fuzzy-wuzzy," Clara cried playfully and pulled a pillow over her chest.
"Don't call me fuzzy-wuzzy, little honeypot." Captain Conner reached for the pillow. "Just call me Captain. Everyone does."
And then the phone rang.
"I think you unplugged the phone." Clara blinked accusingly.
"That's the mobile phone, I forgot," Captain Conner confessed guiltily, "I'll turn it off right now, my lotus flower!"
"Go and see who it is first! Maybe it's important," advised Clara and put on her sweater. "Anyway, I feel my migraines coming back."
With a juicy curse on his lips, Captain Conner stumbled from the canapé and picked up the phone.
"Captain Conner? Stop this nonsense! Get dressed immediately and come here!" a man's voice commanded.
"Who is speaking?" Conner asked perplexed. "Where should I come?"
"You will be picked up. Our car is waiting outside your door."
The connection was cut. Captain Conner looked around at Clara, but the bed was empty. There were choking noises coming from the bathroom. Captain Conner shivered.
"So what?" He shrugged and began to dress. It looked as though duty called, once again. Clara, sweetie pie, when are we going to be lovers?]]></SceneContent>

		<SceneContent><![CDATA[In front of the house was an old-fashioned car with tinted windows and official license plates. A uniformed chauffeur got out and opened the door. In the back seat sat a man in a grey suit. He was clean-shaven and wore a proper parting. On his knees he held a briefcase. He smiled thinly as Conner got in.
"Captain Conner? Sir Toby Spottiswoode. Secretary of State at the Foreign Office."
He overlooked Captain Conner's hand. "The situation is serious. M awaits your arrival."
"M?" asked Conner without understanding.
"The head of the Secret Service. Don't you ever go to the movies, Conner?"
Conner remained silent, offended, and stared out the window as the landscape passed quickly. Finally, the car veered off the highway and entered an abandoned factory site. Steel gates closed as if by magic after the car had passed them.
They stopped in front of a grungy brick building. Sir Toby told Captain Conner to get out. Past saluting gunmen, they entered the building. An elevator took them to a deep basement. Sir Toby opened the door to an office lit by bluish fluorescent lamps.
Behind a computer screen sat a woman of indefinable age with red dyed, highly tousled hair and heavily made-up lips.
"Oh, Captain Conner," she breathed, "welcome to headquarters! The boss is waiting for you."
And addressed to Sir Toby, "The Prime Minister is with him."
"Thank you, Miss Pommeroy," replied Sir Toby Spottiswoode. "By any chance, have you a tie for our captain?"
Giggling, the woman opened a drawer and revealed a crumpled blue nylon tie.
"Here, Captain, put this on before you addresss the Prime Minister."
Captain Conner became aware of his unsuitable attire: casual trousers and flannel shirt, and he hadn't shaved in five days. He gratefully accepted the tie.
"What time do you finish work?" he asked Miss Pommeroy. She lowered her pink eyelids. "You're really something!" she cooed, blushing.
"Enough, Captain!" Disapproval was in Sir Toby's voice. "Come on, we don't have much time."
Sir Toby Spottiswoode led Captain Conner into a large oak-paneled room. One side was completely lined with bookshelves and filing cabinets. On the other walls were framed copper engravings of armoured spaceships from the century before last. A petite lady sat in a wing chair: the prime minister. To her right was a stout man in a naval uniform, to her left a bald civilian. From the desk in the middle of the room, a white-haired giant stood up and walked towards Captain Conner.
"Ah, Captain Conner! How nice that you have time for us. Call me 'M'. This is Admiral Schneider and Mr. Winterbottom, by the way. You've probably heard of the Prime Minister through the press and radio.
Captain Conner uncomfortably pulled his tie knot and muttered something. Then he bowed slightly to the lady. She fixed him motionlessly, with a cold look.
"You are probably wondering, Captain, why we have brought you here," he heard Sir Toby say. "Am I right?"
Captain Conner's silence was irritating.
"Do you or do you not wonder?" shouted Sir Toby impatiently.
M waved away reassuringly and smiled friendly.
"Now, simply tell us, Captain, do you or do you not wonder? Answer freely! What you say within these walls is between us." And addressed to Mr. Winterbottom, "Isn't that right, Mr. Winterbottom?"
"Certainly, sir," he answered.
"And what do you think, Admiral Schneider?"
"Certainly, M."
"There you are." M made an inviting gesture. "Have no inhibitions, my dear Captain Conner, tell us. Do you ask yourself why we brought you here, yes or no?"
"I don't know..." mumbled Captain Conner.
M glanced triumphantly at the Prime Minister.
"What did I say? Captain Conner is our man. He's not blabbing about. He can remain silent. He can be trusted with state secrets."
A warm glow now slid across the Prime Minister's face.
"My dear Captain, I'm so happy to have you with us. The welfare of the free universe is in your hands."
"How--what?" croaked Captain Conner. The knot of his tie choked him beyond words.
M waved his hand. "Listen, Captain Conner, we have little time. Mr. Winterbottom will now give you a status report. I don't need to remind you that this must all be kept secret. Don't tell anyone what you're about to hear! Not even your girlfriend."
Oh, Clara, did Captain Conner mope, when are we going to--
Mr. Winterbottom cleared his throat audibly. Then he went to his desk and pressed a button. Nothing happened.
"The other one, Mr. Winterbottom, the yellow one on the bottom left!" whispered M.
Mr. Winterbottom pushed another button. In the distance, bells were ringing.
"That was the fire alarm. Let me handle this." M went to the desk and quickly tapped on some buttons. The ringing stopped. Then, with a gentle clatter, the panelling moved aside and a large screen appeared on the wall. The light was dimmed gently and the screen lit up. You could see the starry sky, in front of it a grey painted spaceship.
"This, lady and gentlemen," began Mr. Winterbottom, "is Her Majesty's frigate, Atalanta. Last seen on the way to her secret mission in the Tarantula Nebula. She's been missing for a week."
"An accident, perhaps?" Captain Conner suggested. "There are these ionized hydrogen clouds. It's best not to get too close to them."
Admiral Schneider gave Captain Conner an unfriendly look.
"It's out of the question. The Atalanta is led by Commander Hamilton-Blossop. Groxbourne man. Top of the class. Excellent family. Excellent officer. He won't build an accident."
"And what have I got to do with it?" Captain Conner asked wearily. He wondered if Clara would still have migraines tonight. He looked at his watch.
"In the Atalanta's ship vault," continued Mr Winterbottom, "is the Major's brain."
"The Major's brain?" asked Captain Conner. "Which Major?"
"Major Grubert was Princess Artemis' riding instructor," explained Mr. Winterbottom. "His brain stores extremely sensitive information. God help us if it falls into the wrong hands!"
"This must not happen under any circumstances!" cried the Prime Minister in a sharp voice. "We must get the Atalanta back with the Major's brain!"
"In addition", Admiral Schneider said, "the Atalanta carries twenty-six cruise missiles with ultra-kill multiple warheads of thirty-two teraton each. It's unimaginable what terrorists and gangsters could do with them!"
"You see, Captain Conner, this is a delicate task for you. The welfare of the free universe is now in your hands", M concluded and began to stuff his pipe.
"Why don't you just send the space battleship fleet to the Tarantula Nebula and let them search for the missing ship?" Captain Conner asked.
The Prime Minister and her Chief of Intelligence looked at each other with surprise.
"By Jove, that's a splendid idea!" M sounded and struck a match. "Didn't I tell you at first that our Captain Conner is a brilliant man? Please put a squadron on the alert immediately, Admiral Schneider!"
"Then I can go," said Captain Conner, and loosened his tie knot.
"We are most grateful to you, Captain Conner," said the Prime Minister solemnly. "I shall put you forward to the Queen for the small Order of Merit."
"No need," replied Captain Conner, turning to the door. "It was nice meeting you all. Goodbye."
"One moment, Captain!" shouted Admiral Schneider. "Please stay. Your plan is unfeasible."
"What?" M asked in surprise.
"The Atalanta was our only ship," Admiral Schneider confessed. "There is no more space battleship fleet."
"Excuse me?" shouted the Prime Minister.
"Well -- you know, last year's budget cuts, along with salary increases at the Joint Chiefs -- the costs just started to get in way over our heads. We had to sell the good ships and scrap the bad ones. In the end, all we had left was the Atalanta."
"Unbelievable", M murmured, sucking on his pipe.
"And what about the new battle cruisers that were on TV yesterday?" Captain Conner asked. "At the fleet parade in honour of the Queen's birthday?"
"Plastic models," said Admiral Schneider.
"But we are working on a computer animation," Mr. Winterbottom eagerly interjected. "Then everything will look even more realistic --" A scathing look from the admiral silenced him.
M took his pipe out of his mouth. "Well, Captain Conner, it looks like you'll have to fly your Hyperion to the Tarantula Nebula and look for the Atalanta there. There's no other way."
"No time," Captain Conner replied. "I'm terribly sorry."
"Don't forget, Captain, you are in the service of the Queen. A refusal could be interpreted as a breach of duty, if not treason," growled M.
"In the Queen's service? Me?"
M took a piece of paper from his desk. "Do you recognize this? You signed it three years ago at the fair of Alpha Centauri."
Captain Conner grabbed his head in desperation. His penchant for signing forms unread would put him in his grave again!
"All right, I'll sail," he muttered surrenderingly.
"All right, Captain. You will be listed with us as agent 0007 with immediate effect."
"A triple zero!" Mr. Winterbottom gasped. "Licensed to kill!"
"Licensed to kill?" Captain Conner asked, astonished.
"Only in self-defense," said M quickly, "and only abroad."
"In such a case, we shall of course distance ourselves from you," the Prime Minister stressed. "Without a fleet, we cannot afford international entanglements."
"And what do I do at home if I am in danger?"
"Call the police," said M. "As will our other agents."
A buzzer sounded. M pressed a button. "What's up, Pommeroy?"
"We've just received a tape, sir," it squawked from the loudspeaker.
"Put it on the screen, Pommeroy!"
"Right away, sir."
The image of the unfortunate frigate disappeared. Then on the screen appeared a man sitting in a huge leather armchair. He wore an eye patch and had some nasty scars on his face.
"Blowberg!" M exclaimed. "I thought he was long dead."
The man on the screen turned to the viewer. In his lap, he was holding a yoghurt cup with a slimy little alien animal inside. He kept rubbing it with his index finger so that it changed colour, squeaking and squawking.
"We are in possession of Major Grubert's brain," he proclaimed with an expressionless face. "Further, we have twenty-six ultra-kill cruise missiles. If you want them both back, it will cost you a trillion pounds sterling worth of diamonds. Plus I want a hundred virgins for my harem, and the Prime Minister for my kitchen. If you are not interested in this deal, the day after tomorrow I will launch an ultra-kill cruise missile at the capital of the Vulgon Empire and sell the Major's brain to the high bidders in the tabloids. The consequences will be most unpleasant for all of you. End of announcement."
The man's silhouette became blurred and disappeared in a whirl.
"Poor picture quality," noted Mr. Winterbottom.
"You know this man, M?" asked the Prime Minister.
"Heinrich Aristarch Blowberg, Madam," replied the Chief of Intelligence. "Large industrialist and casino owner. According to our files, he died in an accident two years ago."
"So you can be mistaken," said Captain Conner maliciously. The Prime Minister looked at him sore.
"We do not have one trillion pounds sterling, Captain Conner," she said. "There aren't that many diamonds in the whole universe."
"You heard her, Agent 0007. No time for jokes then. Leave immediately and bring back the Atalanta and all her accessories! If necessary, kill Blowberg if he makes any physical threat."
"But where am I going to find him," moaned Captain Conner. "I'm sure he's not in the Tarantula Nebula by now."
M pulled open the drawer of a filing cabinet and reached into a hanging file. He handed Captain Conner a pack of dog-eared leaves.
"Here is the Blowberg file, Agent 0007. Memorise it on the way to the spaceport and then return it to the Secretary of State Sir Toby Spottiswoode. Now go, time is short. God save the Queen!"
"God save the Queen!" cried the others in unison.]]></SceneContent>

		<SceneContent><![CDATA[Accompanied by Secretary of State Sir Toby Spottiswoode, Captain Conner entered his faithful starship [i]Hyperion[/i]. In the airlock they met an elderly man in a white lab coat. He had dishevelled grey hair and wore thick horn-rimmed glasses. Behind him appeared some workers in blue overalls.
"Who are you?" asked Captain Conner, "and what are you doing in my ship?"
"I'm fitting some modifications to your vehicle, Agent 0007. Might come in handy in case things get sticky."
"We haven't got time for your techno gags now, Q," Sir Toby grumbled gruffly. "Agent 0007 will depart immediately. Send your men out, now!"
"But we're not finished yet! The Quark warper is dismantled and the tyre slashers won't be delivered until tomorrow!"
"Never mind. Get out now! Sir Toby waved both hands.
"Where's my crew?" Captain Conner asked.
"I've dismissed them," the old man said.
"What?!"
"Listen, Agent 0007," Sir Toby began, obviously trying to maintain his composure, "by now you should realize the delicate nature of your secret mission. No one, I repeat, no one must know about this. Not even your crew."
"But how am I going to fly the ship all by myself?" Captain Conner took less and less pleasure in it.
"Don't worry, Agent 0007. Our handyman here" -- he pointed to the gray-haired old man -- "has installed everything you need to operate fully automatically. Isn't that right, Q?"
"But", protested Q, "I'm not finished --"
"Poppycock! If it were up to you, Captain Conner couldn't launch in a year. So go on, get out!"
"Pah! All right. Here's something for your personal equipment, 0007." Q handed Captain Conner two flat packs. "A deck of marked cards and a calculator that sprays tear gas if you type in the right code. -- No, the other way around! Like this!"
"Come on. Sir Toby grabbed Q by the sleeve and pulled him out. Captain Conner heard his protesting voice fade, then the outer hatch closed. Sighing, he plugged in the equipment and pressed the button for the fully automatic start.]]></SceneContent>
