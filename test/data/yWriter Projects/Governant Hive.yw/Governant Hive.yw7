		<SceneContent><![CDATA[Silently, the colony ship Governant Hive moved through the endless expanses of space. On board, the android Waldo looked after things and tirelessly controlled the hibernation capsules of the 20,000 pensioners and ten crew members on their way to Arda, the planet that was destined for their retirement. Seven years to go until the planned arrival, but for Waldo it could just as well be seventy or seven thousand. For an android, it didn't matter. He did his duty in the quiet corridors of the mighty spaceship. Day after day. Year after year.
An alarm interrupted Waldo's lonely routine:
"Hibernation capsule battery power low. Crew defrosting in 10 minutes."
Without haste, Waldo went to the ship's headquarters to hoist the solar sails. A high-energy neutrino star close by would reliably charge the ship's battery with climate-neutral, regenerative energy. But what was that? Suddenly, all the displays glowed red, and the alarm sirens wailed through the decks.
"Neutrino storm approaching."
The Governant Hive was already rearing up in the first few squalls. Waldo had to grab the helm to keep from being smashed onto the deck. As the solar storm intensified, the mighty spaceship swayed and lurched, causing the 20,000 hibernation hammocks to collide with frightening force. Waldo knew there was only one thing to do in such an emergency: "All hands on deck!" Calmly and without panic, he set the microwave timers on the ten crew capsules to "defrost". To give Commander Brannigan a head start, he additionally pressed the turbo button on his control panel.
One by one, the hibernation capsules opened and pale crew members staggered around on the swaying deck. Finally, Waldo counted nine miserable creatures. Nine? Shouldn't it be ten? As a precaution, Waldo connected to the ship's computer memory and checked its database. Aha -- the commander was still missing. There was also a new piece of information: The neutrino storm had subsided. That was good.
Loud screaming interrupted Waldo's cybernetic streams of thoughts. A chubby woman with tangled dark hair had thrown herself onto the hibernation capsule of Commander Joko "Jockey" Brannigan. Her behavior was in line with the irrationality level 10. The other crew members dragged her down from the capsule and smashed the glass lintel with a fire axe. Below it, a charred figure came to light. Waldo couldn't find anyone in the crew database who matched this appearance. But he was able to identify the woman: Lieutenant Donalds, the wife of the commander.
"Listen up, everybody!" shouted Lieutenant Olsen, the first mate. "The skipper is dead. Forget about him. I'm your new commander now."
The other crew members stared at him sullenly. They had been trained for five years for this mission, and in those five years a huge resentment had built up against Lieutenant Olsen, who was a fanatical teetotaler, non-smoker and vegan to boot. A preppy of the worst kind.
"Fuck, yeah," said fat Colorado and spat on the deck.
"Your name is, sailor?" the new commander asked him.
"Colorado, uh, sir."
"What kind of a name is that?" Olsen asked him. "And why aren't you clean-shaven?"
"But I have shaved, sir," whimpered Colorado. "A week before we left. After that we had to work non-stop. What a stress that was! Right, boys and girls?"
His teammates nodded dismally.
Olsen frowned. "All right. The first thing everybody does is clear the air. Colorado, you go up the mizzenmast and mend the solar sail."
"Always me," Colorado moaned while his comrades looked at each other uncertainly. "Well, shit, shouldn't we put old jockey Brannigan to rest? What do you say?"
"Colorado's right! Let's drink to the skipper!" cried the sailors.
"Not now," Olsen said. "The safety of the ship has priority."
"But..."
"No buts! Straight to the mast, Colorado. That is an order."
"All right, then. Shit." Grumbling, the bunch scattered.
Satisfied, Christian Olsen retired to his private rooms to sew the fourth strip on his sleeve. To keep an eye on the crew, he switched on the surveillance cameras. On the monitor he saw the crew gathering around the hibernation capsule of the dead Joko Brannigan and passing bottles around. Then the body was doused with a liquid and set on fire.
There must be the wife -- no, the skipper's widow -- behind it, Olsen thought. Although the open insubordination frustrated him, he did not intervene. After all, they still had a long journey together ahead of them, at the end of which Donalds would no longer be his subordinate, but his neighbor. A woman without a man. Thoughtfully, Olsen stroked his chin.
Finally the cremation was finished and the crew set to work. A short time later, Colorado rushed in.
"Shit, sir, listen to this!" He slammed his space helmet on the desk, making the paperweight bounce, and turned on the audio. The whole crew was crowding into Olsen's cabin as noisy music sounded.
"I know that song," shouted Lieutenant Donalds, who was now the new first mate. "This is 'Old Mac Donalds had a farm'."
"Fuck yes," Colorado confirmed. "That's what I received outside in the crow's nest. There's people around, a hundred percent!"
"Why didn't the ship record this transmission?" Olsen asked the radio operator.
"Something like that is suppressed by my junk filter," the radio operator explained. "I don't listen to all kinds of nonsense."
"I've identified the source of the signal", Waldo announced. "A planet very close by."
"Habitable?" Olsen asked.
"Its upper atmosphere is dominated by tremendous ion storms and huge electrical discharges, so we cannot get a clear picture of the surface. But yes, living conditions are extraordinarily good, I'd say. The music transmission proves it."
Commander Olsen clenched his right fist in his left palm. "We should definitely check this out!" he shouted. "Change course immediately! Target: the new planet."
"But our original target 'Arda' has been thoroughly explored for five years", Donalds protested. "Better living conditions for our 20,000 colonists are nowhere to be found."
"Would you like to go back into the hibernation capsule?" Olsen asked icily. "Well, you see, neither do I. Besides, the new planet will be named after me. 'Olsen's World' sounds much better than 'Arda', doesn't it? So stop blabbering, Lieutenant, and turn the wheel!"
Donald's eyes rolled. "As you wish, sir. But I warned you."
"Get the longboat ready!" Olsen shouted to the other crew members. "We'll all land on the planet together and get some fresh air."
"Shouldn't someone stay aboard the Governant Hive, sir?" Waldo objected. "After all, there are 20,000 people in the hibernation pods."
Olsen's eyes fell on the unshaven Colorado who was just putting on a sun hat. "Colorado, you stay here and hold the fort."
"What? Me? Shit!" Colorado threw his hat on the ground and stomped on it.
"No arguments. And remember, the Governant Hive is not built for atmospheric service. So do not immerse  unless it's an absolute emergency."
"When would such an emergency arise?" Colorado asked, putting on his crumpled sun hat.
"Let me think," replied Olsen. "Well, for example, if our robust shuttle were to break up in the atmosphere. Or then, when the crew has been infected with deadly alien spores and must be brought back on board. Or anything else. Just use your brain, sailor."
"Fuck yes, sir."
"And one more thing, Colorado: Don't keep swearing. What's it look like?"
"We're in orbit, sir," Waldo reported. "And the shuttle is clear."
The screen showed a swirling cloud cover illuminated by lightning. Olsen had been studying planetary exploration long enough to know that first impressions are usually trough. Again, one could expect a soft core under the rough shell. Nevertheless he wanted to play it safe.
"I think the planet has a pleasant, healthy climate, but you'd better put on your red shirts," he ordered. "And don't forget your mountain caps."
Then it started.]]></SceneContent>
