		<SceneContent><![CDATA[A mechanic helped Rick into his spacesuit. "They gave you not more than a scooter", the man stated. He wiped a grease stain off Rick's visor. "Yeah, seems as if they've learned from Barlo's flop, after all. He went down the drain with a shuttle. Quite expensive, that."
"Barlo?" asked Rick. "Who is Barlo?"
The mechanic hunkered down and set a strap tight at Rick's left boot. Then he looked up and scratched his stubbly chin.
"Midshipman Barlo? Oh, I see. You can't know him after all. It's because you've come aboard to replace him, haven't you. OK then. Barlo--[i]Mr. Barlo[/i], sir--was sent to an away mission. Alone. Because of the risk, you know. To minimize losses and so on. Anyway--the wreck he was to explore, blew up as soon as Barlo--[i]Mr. Barlo[/i], sir--tried to dock. The shuttle crumbled, too. The old man was quite mad. Will say, the captain, sir, sorry."
For a while, the man occupied himself with the other boot, and Rick's view swept thoughtfully over the shuttle bay's skid-marked floor.
[i]Risk? Minimize losses? Crumbled?[/i] No wonder that Rick's mates weren't to be seen while Sub-Lieutenant Froffman had been looking for a volunteer. [i]Why have they joined the Space Patrol, anyway, [/i]he thought scornfully. [i]Pussies[/i].
The [i]Armadillo's [/i]valuable shuttles were lined up neatly: nifty, roomy and fast, adorned by the Space Patrol's proud insignia. All jet engines angled exactly. The cruiser owned fourteen of them, Rick had had to memorize during his first days aboard. [i]On my next mission, I will pilot one of these. I'm not a dud like Barlo. I will prove.[/i]
"May I ask, sir, what's it about, this time?" The mechanic checked Rick's respirator with a tap.
"A drifting Cyber Age spaceship wreck", Rick explained. "Scans are ambiguous. Possibly, a life support system is still active. Better have a look before atomizing it."
The mechanic whistled gently. "Another Cyber Age relict. Had two of them, last year. That was when Mulli and Sanz bought the farm. Pretty malicious, the artificial intelligence. Old Jarge of the [i]Alligator [/i]got something implanted by them dirty machines before they let him return to his ship. Then--"
"Don't tell it", Rick interrupted the man. "And mount my DataPad where I can reach it."
The mechanic nodded, and tore a velcro strip off Rick's hip. "Your first away mission, sir?"
"Can't deny", Rick admitted.
"Of course, you 'volunteered', sir. Didn't you?"
"What else?" [i]What a question.[/i] Action at last, after all the weeks of boring instructions. Rick was thinking of his paragon, [i]Captain Bold[/i] on TV. Volunteering was not the point. The point was being the right man at the right place at the right time.
The mechanic's small eyes flitted around. His mouth came close to Rick's ear.
"There's a way out, sir", he whispered. "It's not too late yet."
