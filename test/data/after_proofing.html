		<P CLASS="textbody"><!-- Meet Hal, threatened by Vurdi -->Hal
		Spacejock was sitting at the <EM>Black Gull&rsquo;s</EM> flight
		console, his attention riveted to a small chessboard balanced
		amongst the toggle switches, flashing lights and status displays. a
		few weeks earlier he&rsquo;d read an article extolling the benefits
		of the ancient game: how playing it would sharpen his mind, improve
		his memory and increase his attraction to the opposite sex. Chess
		had been an important part of his daily routine ever since, but
		after two hundred and seventy-six losses in a row Hal was beginning
		to doubt the article&rsquo;s claims. He didn&rsquo;t feel any
		smarter and he couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time he&rsquo;d
		spoken to a member of the opposite sex, let alone had one attracted
		to him. Briefly, he wondered whether it had been such a clever idea
		to play against the Navcom, the Black Gull&rsquo;s onboard
		computer. Underpowered and outdated, it was still more than capable
		of running the ship&rsquo;s accounts, navigation and life support
		systems while beating humans at simple board games. However, since
		Hal was the only human aboard the Black Gull, his choice of
		opponents was limited.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">&ldquo;Your turn,&rdquo; said the
		Navcom, in a neutral female voice.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still thinking.&rdquo;</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re planning your
		opening move, can I tell you about a special offer?&rdquo;</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">&ldquo;What kind of offer?&rdquo; asked
		Hal suspiciously.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">&ldquo;<STRONG>Planet books</STRONG>
		have a chess title on sale.&rdquo; - &ldquo;Really? Put it on
		main.&rdquo;</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">The wide viewscreen above the console
		turned red, and the word &lsquo;SaLE&rsquo; appeared in vibrating
		yellow text. The letters grew legs and marched off the screen,
		bringing a wire basket on wheels into view.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need all this
		crap,&rdquo; said Hal. &ldquo;Just show me the deal.&rdquo;</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">&ldquo;Almost there,&rdquo; said the
		Navcom. &ldquo;Keep watching.&rdquo;</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">A flock of pigeons burst from the
		basket, leaving a tumbling cloud of feathers which dropped to the
		ground and formed the words &lsquo;Special Offer&rsquo;. a gust of
		wind blew the feathers away, and a book title flashed up on the
		screen.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">&ldquo;Chess for the intellectually
		challenged?&rdquo; said Hal, staring at the cover in disbelief. &ldquo;Is
		this some kind of joke?&rdquo;</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of a popular
		series,&rdquo; said the Navcom.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">&ldquo;What are the others? Interstellar
		navigation for nutters? Moon landings for morons?&rdquo;</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">&ldquo;Shall I add those titles to your
		basket?&rdquo;</P>

		struggle to live within their means. It was unusual to see building
		work or renovations, so the extensive refurbishment to the decrepit

		from the Black Gull&rsquo;s airlock, blinking in the sudden light.
		On the far side of the landing field the sun was setting behind the
		Lamira spaceport&rsquo;s administration block, which shimmered in
		the late afternoon heat. Clustered around the spaceport buildings
		were the &lsquo;A&rsquo; list - modern, powerful ships fitted with
		every comfort. Parked close to the amenities, their crews could
		dine at one of several restaurants, enjoy the heated swimming pool
		and browse the shopping arcade at their leisure.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Hal&rsquo;s ship was somewhat further
		down the alphabet, and was therefore sitting in a disused corner of
		the field about as far from the amenities as the nearest moon. The
		area around the Black Gull was little more than a graveyard for
		derelicts, and most of the landing pads nearby were occupied by
		graffiti-splashed wrecks with jagged gaps in their crumpled hulls.
		Some of the ships seemed familiar, and when Hal looked closer he
		realised the rusted hulks were Rigel-class freighters like his own.
		One or two were actually in better shape.</P>

		dropped the last chess piece into the small wooden box and looked
		around the flight deck. Despite his best efforts with the mop, it
		didn&rsquo;t look particularly clean, but compared to its previous
		state it was as sterile as a hospital ward. After a moment&rsquo;s
		hesitation, he sat in the pilot&rsquo;s chair. &ldquo;Navcom, do
