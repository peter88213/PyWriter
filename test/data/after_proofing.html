		Spacejock was sitting at the <em>Black Gull&rsquo;s</em> flight
		console, his attention riveted to a small chessboard balanced
		amongst the toggle switches, flashing lights and status displays. a
		few weeks earlier he&rsquo;d read an article extolling the benefits
		of the ancient game: how playing it would sharpen his mind, improve
		his memory and increase his attraction to the opposite sex. Chess
		had been an important part of his daily routine ever since, but
		after two hundred and seventy-six losses in a row Hal was beginning
		to doubt the article&rsquo;s claims. He didn&rsquo;t feel any
		smarter and he couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time he&rsquo;d
		spoken to a member of the opposite sex, let alone had one attracted
		to him. Briefly, he wondered whether it had been such a clever idea
		to play against the Navcom, the Black Gull&rsquo;s onboard
		computer. Underpowered and outdated, it was still more than capable
		of running the ship&rsquo;s accounts, navigation and life support
		systems while beating humans at simple board games. However, since
		Hal was the only human aboard the Black Gull, his choice of
		opponents was limited.</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&lsquo;Your turn,&rsquo; said the
		Navcom, in a neutral female voice.</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m thinking.&rsquo;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&lsquo;While you&rsquo;re planning your
		opening move, can I tell you about a special offer?&rsquo;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">. . .</p>

	<div id="ScID:1" dir="ltr"><p class="textbody"><!-- Jerling buys team. Discusses Seraph. -->On
		planet Forg, a small crowd had gathered outside the local sky
		hockey stadium. South Forgberg was not a prosperous area - the
		semi-detached houses were modest and the residents faced a constant
		struggle to live within their means. It was unusual to see building
		work or renovations, so the extensive refurbishment to the decrepit
		old stadium had been a talking point for months.</p>

	<div id="ScID:3" dir="ltr"><p class="textbody"><!-- Hal takes a call from Jerling -->Hal
		was pacing the Black Gull&rsquo;s flight deck, ready to put his
		fist through the nearest wall. &lsquo;What do you mean, you can&rsquo;t
		call Jerling back? What do you mean you didn&rsquo;t save his
		details?&rsquo;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&lsquo;I erased the record after you

		sign of Jerling&rsquo;s pilot,&rsquo; said Hal, who was standing in
		the Black Gull&rsquo;s airlock peering through a scratched,
		yellowed porthole. He cupped his hands to the plastic and squinted,
		but it made little difference. &lsquo;There could be an army out
		there and I wouldn&rsquo;t know it.&rsquo;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you open the
		door?&rsquo; asked the Navcom.</p>

	<div id="ScID:5" dir="ltr"><p class="textbody"><!-- Hal going to port control -->Hal
		emerged from the Black Gull&rsquo;s airlock, blinking in the sudden
		light. On the far side of the landing field the sun was setting
		behind the Lamira spaceport&rsquo;s administration block, which
		shimmered in the late afternoon heat. Clustered around the
		spaceport buildings were the &ldquo;A&rdquo; list - modern,
		powerful ships fitted with every comfort. Parked close to the
		amenities, their crews could dine at one of several restaurants,
		enjoy the heated swimming pool and browse the shopping arcade at
		their leisure.</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">Hal&rsquo;s ship was somewhat further
		down the alphabet, and was therefore sitting in a disused corner of
		the field about as far from the amenities as the nearest moon. The
		area around the Black Gull was little more than a graveyard for
		derelicts, and most of the landing pads nearby were occupied by
		graffiti-splashed wrecks with jagged gaps in their crumpled hulls.
		Some of the ships seemed familiar, and when Hal looked closer he
		realised the rusted hulks were Rigel-class freighters like his own.
		One or two were actually in better shape.</p>

	<div id="ScID:6" dir="ltr"><p class="textbody"><!-- Clunk checking computer for Incubots. -->Clunk
		dropped the last chess piece into the small wooden box and looked
		around the flight deck. Despite his best efforts with the mop, it
		didn&rsquo;t look particularly clean, but compared to its previous
		state it was as sterile as a hospital ward. After a moment&rsquo;s
		hesitation, he sat in the pilot&rsquo;s chair. &lsquo;Navcom, do
		you have a business directory?&rsquo;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&lsquo;Run a search, please. All details
		on a company called Incubots.&rsquo;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">There was a brief pause. &lsquo;Owned by
		Redge Muller. Incubots specialises in robot programming and
		advanced pilot training.&rsquo;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">Clunk looked relieved. &lsquo;So that&rsquo;s
		what Mr. Jerling has in store for me. When I questioned him on the
		subject he was rather evasive.&rsquo;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&lsquo;Humans tell lies about the most
		trivial matters.&rsquo;</p>

		an elevator, where he pressed the button marked &ldquo;Portmaster&rdquo;.</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">Hal watched the floor numbers changing
		as he dropped further and further underground. He&rsquo;d expected
		the Portmaster to have a spacious office with a view of the whole
		landing field, but instead he seemed to have an office in the
		basement. Below the basement, amended Hal, eying the elevator&rsquo;s
		control panel. He&rsquo;d passed that already.</p>
