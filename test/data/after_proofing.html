		Spacejock was sitting at the <em class="western">Black Gull's</em>
		flight console, his attention riveted to a small chessboard
		balanced amongst the toggle switches, flashing lights and status
		displays. a few weeks earlier he'd read an article extolling the
		benefits of the ancient game: how playing it would sharpen his
		mind, improve his memory and increase his attraction to the
		opposite sex. Chess had been an important part of his daily routine
		ever since, but after two hundred and seventy-six losses in a row
		Hal was beginning to doubt the article's claims. He didn't feel any
		smarter and he couldn't remember the last time he'd spoken to a
		member of the opposite sex, let alone had one attracted to him.
		Briefly, he wondered whether it had been such a clever idea to play
		against the Navcom, the Black Gull's onboard computer. Underpowered
		and outdated, it was still more than capable of running the ship's
		accounts, navigation and life support systems while beating humans
		at simple board games. However, since Hal was the only human aboard
		the Black Gull, his choice of opponents was limited.</p>

		planet Forg, a small crowd had gathered outside the local sky
		hockey stadium. South Forgberg was not a prosperous area - the
		semi-detached houses were modest and the residents faced a constant
		struggle to live within their means. It was unusual to see building
		work or renovations, so the extensive refurbishment to the decrepit
		old stadium had been a talking point for months.</p>

		Jerling back? What do you mean you didn't save his details?&quot;</p>

		made little difference. &quot;There could be an army out there and

		emerged from the Black Gull's airlock, blinking in the sudden
		light. On the far side of the landing field the sun was setting
		behind the Lamira spaceport's administration block, which shimmered
		in the late afternoon heat. Clustered around the spaceport
		buildings were the 'A' list - modern, powerful ships fitted with
		every comfort. Parked close to the amenities, their crews could
		dine at one of several restaurants, enjoy the heated swimming pool
		and browse the shopping arcade at their leisure.</p>
		<p class="einzug-erste-zeile">Hal's ship was somewhat further down
		the alphabet, and was therefore sitting in a disused corner of the
		field about as far from the amenities as the nearest moon. The area
		around the Black Gull was little more than a graveyard for
		derelicts, and most of the landing pads nearby were occupied by
		graffiti-splashed wrecks with jagged gaps in their crumpled hulls.
		Some of the ships seemed familiar, and when Hal looked closer he
		realised the rusted hulks were Rigel-class freighters like his own.
		One or two were actually in better shape.</p>

		dropped the last chess piece into the small wooden box and looked
		around the flight deck. Despite his best efforts with the mop, it
		didn't look particularly clean, but compared to its previous state
		it was as sterile as a hospital ward. After a moment's hesitation,
		he sat in the pilot's chair. &quot;Navcom, do you have a business
		directory?&quot;</p>
		<p class="einzug-erste-zeile">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
		<p class="einzug-erste-zeile">&quot;Run a search, please. All

		changing as he dropped further and further underground. He'd
		expected the Portmaster to have a spacious office with a view of
		the whole landing field, but instead he seemed to have an office in
