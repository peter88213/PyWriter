	<div id="ScID:1" dir="ltr"><p class="textbody"><!-- Meet Hal, threatened by Vurdi -->Hal
		Spacejock was sitting at the Black Gull's flight console, his
		attention riveted to a small chessboard balanced amongst the toggle
		switches, flashing lights and status displays. a few weeks earlier
		he'd read an article extolling the benefits of the ancient game:
		how playing it would sharpen his mind, improve his memory and
		increase his attraction to the opposite sex. Chess had been an
		important part of his daily routine ever since, but after two
		hundred and seventy-six losses in a row Hal was beginning to doubt
		the article's claims. He didn't feel any smarter and he couldn't
		remember the last time he'd spoken to a member of the opposite sex,
		let alone had one attracted to him. Briefly, he wondered whether it
		had been such a clever idea to play against the Navcom, the Black
		Gull's onboard computer. Underpowered and outdated, it was still
		more than capable of running the ship's accounts, navigation and
		life support systems while beating humans at simple board games.
		However, since Hal was the only human aboard the Black Gull, his
		choice of opponents was limited.</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&quot;Your turn,&quot; said the Navcom,
		in a neutral female voice.</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&quot;I'm thinking.&quot;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&quot;While you're planning your opening
		move, can I tell you about a special offer?&quot;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&quot;What kind of offer?&quot; asked
		Hal suspiciously.</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&quot;Planet books have a chess title on
		sale.&quot;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&quot;Really? Put it on main.&quot;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">The wide viewscreen above the console
		turned red, and the word 'SaLE' appeared in vibrating yellow text.
		The letters grew legs and marched off the screen, bringing a wire
		basket on wheels into view.</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&quot;I don't need all this crap,&quot;
		said Hal. &quot;Just show me the deal.&quot;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&quot;Almost there,&quot; said the
		Navcom. &quot;Keep watching.&quot;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">A flock of pigeons burst from the
		basket, leaving a tumbling cloud of feathers which dropped to the
		ground and formed the words 'Special Offer'. a gust of wind blew
		the feathers away, and a book title flashed up on the screen.</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&quot;Chess for the intellectually
		challenged?&quot; said Hal, staring at the cover in disbelief. &quot;Is
		this some kind of joke?&quot;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&quot;It's part of a popular series,&quot;
		said the Navcom.</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&quot;What are the others? Interstellar
		navigation for nutters? Moon landings for morons?&quot;</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">&quot;Shall I add those titles to your
		basket?&quot;</p>

		struggle to live within their means. It was unusual to see building
		work or renovations, so the extensive refurbishment to the decrepit
		old stadium had been a talking point for months.</p>

		emerged from the Black Gull's airlock, blinking in the sudden
		light. On the far side of the landing field the sun was setting
		behind the Lamira spaceport's administration block, which shimmered
		in the late afternoon heat. Clustered around the spaceport
		buildings were the 'A' list - modern, powerful ships fitted with
		every comfort. Parked close to the amenities, their crews could
		dine at one of several restaurants, enjoy the heated swimming pool
		and browse the shopping arcade at their leisure.</p>
		<p class="firstlineindent">Hal's ship was somewhat further down the
		alphabet, and was therefore sitting in a disused corner of the
		field about as far from the amenities as the nearest moon. The area
		around the <em class="western">Black Gull</em> was little more than
		a graveyard for derelicts, and most of the landing pads nearby were
		occupied by graffiti-splashed wrecks with jagged gaps in their
		crumpled hulls. Some of the ships seemed familiar, and when Hal
		looked closer he realised the rusted hulks were Rigel-class
		freighters like his own. One or two were actually in better shape.</p>

		dropped the last chess piece into the small wooden box and looked
		around the flight deck. Despite his best efforts with the mop, it
		didn't look particularly clean, but compared to its previous state
		it was as sterile as a hospital ward. After a moment's hesitation,
		he sat in the pilot's chair. &quot;Navcom, do you have a business
		directory?&quot;</p>
