Combining relentless action with non-stop laughs, Hal Spacejock explodes onto the science fiction scene with the subtlety of a meteor strike and the hushed reverence of a used car salesman.">

		<P CLASS="western"><!-- - Meet Hal, threatened by Vurdi

 - -->Hal
		Spacejock is aboard his ship, the Black Gull, which is parked at
		the spaceport on planet Lamira. Hal's waiting for a cargo job, he's
		not fussy as long as it's legal. So far, after several days, the
		only jobs he's been offered have involved smuggling, gun-running or
		drugs.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Always short of money,
		Hal has arranged an interview with his financial backers in the
		hope of increasing his loan. There's a knock, but when Hal goes to
		let the loan people in he's confronted by a large robot which pins
		him to the deck. It's Brutus, an enforcer belonging to Vurdi the
		debt collector. Vurdi enters and explains that he's arrived to
		collect overdue payments on behalf of the loan company. Hal is
		confused, he thought they were supposed to be lending him money.
		Vurdi explains that it was a ploy to get aboard, since the company
		has had trouble getting face-to-face with Hal.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Hal doesn't have any
		money, so Vurdi says he'll take an arm or leg instead, and sets
		Brutus on him.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">During the scuffle, Hal
		manages to tell Vurdi that he accepted a cargo job earlier in the
		day, and will use the proceeds to settle his debts. Vurdi is
		suspicious, but calls Brutus off and gives Hal 24 hours.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">After Vurdi leaves, Hal
		discusses things with the Black Gull's onboard computer (the
		Navcom), reviewing the cargo jobs he's been offered. He chooses the
		one which sounds less risky than the others, a freight job offered
		by the Jerling corporation. The Navcom objects, reminding Hal that
		he turned it down earlier because he thought it involved stolen
		goods. Hal doesn't care - he can't afford to be choosy any more.</P>

		<P CLASS="western"><!-- - Jerling buys team. Discusses Seraph.

 - -->Walter
		Jerling is a businessman on Forg, a planet in the same star system
		as Lamira. He owns several enterprises - real estate, factories,
		etc. We meet him at the grand opening of a new sky hockey stadium,
		puffing on his cigar and finishing off the ceremony without much
		enthusiasm. After a smattering of polite applause from the small
		crowd, he departs in his limo.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">In the car he complains
		that he's little more than a figurehead, hopping from one PR
		exercise to the next. He recalls the early days, when he was
		personally involved in everything. His assistant, Carina, reminds
		him that he was running himself ragged before he mastered the art
		of delegating. Jerling replies that delegating can lead to people
		ripping him off or revealing company secrets to the Hinchfigs
		(competitors). Moans that the Hinchfigs get bigger crowds at their
		openings, Carina points out that they pay the crowds more to turn
		up.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Jerling catches up on a
		few minor business matters. He reluctantly approves the recycling
		of older company equipment (including several robots), then digs
		until Carina gives him something more interesting to think about.
		He discovers there's a freight job which is going wrong, and as the
		limo draws into the head office carpark Jerling decides to handle
		it himself.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">He examines the Seraph
		file. There's a shipment of robot parts ordered and paid for, but
		the source planet (Seraph IV) is in the middle of war games and the
		massed ships of the Seraph Space Corps have already shot down three
		unarmed freighters by mistake. The parts are needed urgently by
		Jerling's assembly line, they're putting together a last-minute
		order of robots for the Emperor's summer palace. Late delivery
		isn't an option.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Carina explains that they
		can't risk their own ships, they wouldn't be covered by insurance
		and anyway, none of their pilots will fly into the danger zone.
		They tried to hire a freelancer but none of them wanted the job
		either - they were all warned off by a Spacers Guild bulletin.
		Jerling asks why they didn't try non-Guild pilots, Carina explains
		that they could only locate one and he turned it down because he
		was convinced it was a stolen goods racket. Jerling is annoyed that
		his staff hid the problem from him. Carina explains that they
		didn't want to worry him. Jerling says they should have come to him
		before, this is important, if they lose preferred supplier status
		his business is at risk, and worse still the Hinchfigs will gain on
		him.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Jerling asks Carina to
		call the idiot, the one who thought it was stolen goods. Before the
		assistant makes the call, she discovers that there's a message from
		the 'idiot' already - he wants the job. Carina tries to pursuade
		Jerling that others can deal with the issue but Jerling's fired up
		and won't let go, it's his pet project.</P>

 - -->Back
		with Hal, Jerling's call comes through and the businessman explains
		about his cargo, reassures Hal it's not stolen goods, then explains
		he has a pilot at the Lamira Spaceport (the same location as Hal)
		who needs a lift to Seraph IV. If Hal can take him, the pilot will
		return the favour by landing Hal's ship when they arrive at the
		destination.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Hal says he doesn't need
		help, Jerling explains that the landing is at night, with no
		guidance. This makes Hal suspicious about the job again, but he
		decides that nothing could be worse than another session with
		Brutus. Jerling reassures him that the pilot can handle everything
		and reminds him that delivery is to his premises on Forg. Hal
		agrees to the job, starts to ask for an advance but Jerling
		disconnects.</P>

		pilot and goes to the airlock to admit them. Instead of a human,
		there's a robot outside, and for a moment Hal thinks Brutus has
		returned. It isn't though, it's a run-down, obsolete robot with
		mismatched legs and a squashy, furrowed face. The geriatric robot
		smiles at Hal and explains politely that it's Jerling's pilot.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Hal closes the airlock in

		that an old robot like that can't possibly land his valuable ship.

		ramps - a large, heavy-duty cargo ramp which vehicles and robots

		from the side of the ship and admits visitors to the flight deck
		via an airlock.)</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">He has to get to ground

		ute). The robot refuses.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Hal decides to walk and
		sets off across the field towards the distant buildings, but the
		field is covered in thick shoulder-high grasses with spore pods
		(Like knotted pampas grass). After struggling heroically, Hal gives
		up and returns in a bad temper. Approaching the landing pad again,
		he ducks down in the grass and sneaks towards the maintenance
		robot's vehicle, intending to borrow it. He's about to clamber
		aboard when the robot snaps something on the fuel pipes, causing a
		gushing leak. Hal ducks as the robot returns to the vehicle and
		grabs a tool kit.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">While the robot is busy
		mending the pipes, Hal leaps into the vehicle and starts it up. The
		robot spots him and pursues. The vehicle accelerates, but the robot
		manages to grab hold and swing itself aboard. Hal wiggles the
		joystick and the wild movements throw the robot from side to side,
		battering it against the sides of the tray. One last violent twist
		of the controls hurls the robot from the back of the vehicle, and
		it cartwheels through the grass before coming to a halt in a
		sparking, smoking huddle.</P>
		<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Hal drives off, oblivious

		(There's an equivalent to the internet called Galnet, but Hal can't

		Clunk discovers that Incubots makes parts for new robots and
