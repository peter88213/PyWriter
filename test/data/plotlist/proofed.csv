ChID:33|Act I – Setup|||Act One is all about setting the stage: readers should get an idea of who your protagonist is, what their everyday life is like, and what’s important to them. Of course, nobody’s life is perfect, and the exposition should give readers a sense of the current challenges facing the main character. Their desire to overcome these challenges will inform their overarching character goal.
ScID:1||Exposition|Meet Hal, threatened by Vurdi|This is a note. Notice how the N icon shows up when there's a note attached to a scene.
ScID:2||Inciting Incident|Jerling buys team. Discusses Seraph.|This is the catalyst that sets the protagonist’s adventure in motion. The inciting incident is a crucial beat in the three-act story structure: without it, the story in question wouldn’t exist. The inciting incident proposes a journey to the protagonist — one that could help them change their situation and achieve their goal.

ScID:68||Plot Point Two|Hal after almost running Clunk down. Picks him up.|Our poor protagonist has fallen on hard times. They thought they were making headway on their goal and then the Midpoint came and threw them off their rhythm.

ScID:101||Pre Climax|Hal and Clunk fleeing in Gull|Also called “The Dark Night of the Soul,” Act Three starts with the final clash between the protagonist and the antagonist. We’ve experienced the entire journey with the main character — but this is where we get our first glimpse of the antagonist’s true strength, and it usually catches the main character off guard. Even though most readers are aware that the protagonist typically wins the day, we should have some doubt here about how the last act will play out, and if the main character will be okay.

ScID:114|||Terry ties Hal in hold, leaves back doors open.|
ScID:116||Climax|Hal dodges Brutus, escapes the hold.|The climax signifies the final moments of the story’s overarching conflict. Since the antagonist has just hit the protagonist where it hurts in the previous beat, the protagonist has to lick their wounds. Then they face-off one more time and the main character lays the conflict to rest.
ScID:119||Denouement|Black Gull hyperspaces to oblivion|Finally, the dust settles. If the protagonist’s goal is not immediately obtained during the Climax, the denouement is where this should be achieved (or redefined, if their goal changed during Act Three).
