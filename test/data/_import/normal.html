<H2 CLASS="western">Chapter 1</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><!-- Meet Hal, threatened by Vurdi -->Hal
Spacejock was sitting at the Black Gull's flight console, his
attention riveted to a small chessboard balanced amongst the toggle
switches, flashing lights and status displays. a few weeks earlier
he'd read an article extolling the benefits of the ancient game: how
playing it would sharpen his mind, improve his memory and increase
his attraction to the opposite sex. Chess had been an important part
of his daily routine ever since, but after two hundred and
seventy-six losses in a row Hal was beginning to doubt the article's
claims. He didn't feel any smarter and he couldn't remember the last
time he'd spoken to a member of the opposite sex, let alone had one
attracted to him. Briefly, he wondered whether it had been such a
clever idea to play against the Navcom, the Black Gull's onboard
computer. Underpowered and outdated, it was still more than capable
of running the ship's accounts, navigation and life support systems
while beating humans at simple board games. However, since Hal was
the only human aboard the Black Gull, his choice of opponents was
limited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;Your turn,&quot;
said the Navcom, in a neutral female voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;I'm thinking.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;While you're
planning your opening move, can I tell you about a special offer?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;What kind of
offer?&quot; asked Hal suspiciously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;Planet books
have a chess title on sale.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;Really? Put it
on main.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">The wide viewscreen
above the console turned red, and the word 'SaLE' appeared in
vibrating yellow text. The letters grew legs and marched off the
screen, bringing a wire basket on wheels into view.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;I don't need
all this crap,&quot; said Hal. &quot;Just show me the deal.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;Almost there,&quot;
said the Navcom. &quot;Keep watching.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">A flock of pigeons
burst from the basket, leaving a tumbling cloud of feathers which
dropped to the ground and formed the words 'Special Offer'. a gust of
wind blew the feathers away, and a book title flashed up on the
screen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;Chess for the
intellectually challenged?&quot; said Hal, staring at the cover in
disbelief. &quot;Is this some kind of joke?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;It's part of a
popular series,&quot; said the Navcom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;What are the
others? Interstellar navigation for nutters? Moon landings for
morons?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;Shall I add
those titles to your basket?&quot;</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><!-- Jerling buys team. Discusses Seraph. -->On
planet Forg, a small crowd had gathered outside the local sky hockey
stadium. South Forgberg was not a prosperous area - the semi-detached
houses were modest and the residents faced a constant struggle to
live within their means. It was unusual to see building work or
renovations, so the extensive refurbishment to the decrepit old
stadium had been a talking point for months.</P>

was pacing the Black Gull's flight deck, ready to put his fist
through the nearest wall. &quot;What do you mean, you can't call
Jerling back? What do you mean you didn't save his details?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;I erased the
record after you turned the job down.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;So look it up
again!&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;Negative, we
can't afford the search fees.&quot; The Navcom hesitated.
&quot;Incidentally, it's your move.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;How can you
think of a bloody chess game at a time like this?&quot;</P>

sign of Jerling's pilot,&quot; said Hal, who was standing in the
Black Gull's airlock peering through a scratched, yellowed porthole.
He cupped his hands to the plastic and squinted, but it made little
difference. &quot;There could be an army out there and I wouldn't
know it.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;Why don't you
open the door?&quot; asked the Navcom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;No thanks.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><!-- Hal going to port control -->Hal
emerged from the Black Gull's airlock, blinking in the sudden light.
On the far side of the landing field the sun was setting behind the
Lamira spaceport's administration block, which shimmered in the late
afternoon heat. Clustered around the spaceport buildings were the 'A'
list - modern, powerful ships fitted with every comfort. Parked close
to the amenities, their crews could dine at one of several
restaurants, enjoy the heated swimming pool and browse the shopping
arcade at their leisure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Hal's ship was
somewhat further down the alphabet, and was therefore sitting in a
disused corner of the field about as far from the amenities as the
nearest moon. The area around the <EM CLASS="western">Black Gull</EM>
was little more than a graveyard for derelicts, and most of the
landing pads nearby were occupied by graffiti-splashed wrecks with
jagged gaps in their crumpled hulls. Some of the ships seemed
familiar, and when Hal looked closer he realised the rusted hulks
were Rigel-class freighters like his own. One or two were actually in
better shape.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><!-- Clunk checking computer for Incubots. -->Clunk
dropped the last chess piece into the small wooden box and looked
around the flight deck. Despite his best efforts with the mop, it
didn't look particularly clean, but compared to its previous state it
was as sterile as a hospital ward. After a moment's hesitation, he
sat in the pilot's chair. &quot;Navcom, do you have a business
directory?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;Run a search,
please. All details on a company called Incubots.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">There was a brief
pause. &quot;Owned by Redge Muller. Incubots specialises in robot
programming and advanced pilot training.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Clunk looked
relieved. &quot;So that's what Mr. Jerling has in store for me. When
I questioned him on the subject he was rather evasive.&quot;</P>

left the maintenance vehicle in the spaceport's outer carpark and
walked to the admin block. An information kiosk directed him to an
elevator, where he pressed the button marked 'Portmaster'.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">Hal watched the floor
numbers changing as he dropped further and further underground. He'd
expected the Portmaster to have a spacious office with a view of the
whole landing field, but instead he seemed to have an office in the
basement. Below the basement, amended Hal, eying the elevator's
control panel. He'd passed that already.</P>

Linten studied Hal across the desk, eyes narrowed. &quot;Are you
telling me this Jerling character will pay your bill?&quot;</P>

can't deliver his cargo if the Gull is stuck here, can I?&quot;</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;Fifty-two,&quot;
said Hal, smothering a grin. &quot;That's Clunk.&quot; He leant
towards the commset. &quot;Clunk, is the ship in danger from this,
er, fire?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">&quot;Not yet, Mr
Spacejock, but it soon will be. Would you like me to move it out of
