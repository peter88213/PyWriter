      <Desc><![CDATA[Hal Spacejock isaboard his ship, the Black Gull, which is parked at the spaceport onplanet Lamira. Hal's waiting for a cargo job, he's not fussy as longas it's legal. So far, after several days, the only jobs he's beenoffered have involved smuggling, gun-running or drugs.
Always short ofmoney, Hal has arranged an interview with his financial backers inthe hope of increasing his loan. There's a knock, but when Hal goesto let the loan people in he's confronted by a large robot which pinshim to the deck. It's Brutus, an enforcer belonging to Vurdi the debtcollector. Vurdi enters and explains that he's arrived to collectoverdue payments on behalf of the loan company. Hal is confused, hethought they were supposed to be lending him money. Vurdi explainsthat it was a ploy to get aboard, since the company has had troublegetting face-to-face with Hal.
Hal doesn't have anymoney, so Vurdi says he'll take an arm or leg instead, and setsBrutus on him.
During the scuffle,Hal manages to tell Vurdi that he accepted a cargo job earlier in theday, and will use the proceeds to settle his debts. Vurdi issuspicious, but calls Brutus off and gives Hal 24 hours.
After Vurdi leaves,Hal discusses things with the Black Gull's onboard computer (theNavcom), reviewing the cargo jobs he's been offered. He chooses theone which sounds less risky than the others, a freight job offered bythe Jerling corporation. The Navcom objects, reminding Hal that heturned it down earlier because he thought it involved stolen goods.Hal doesn't care - he can't afford to be choosy any more.]]></Desc>

      <Desc><![CDATA[Walter Jerling is abusinessman on Forg, a planet in the same star system as Lamira. Heowns several enterprises - real estate, factories, etc. We meet himat the grand opening of a new sky hockey stadium, puffing on hiscigar and finishing off the ceremony without much enthusiasm. After asmattering of polite applause from the small crowd, he departs in hislimo.
In the car hecomplains that he's little more than a figurehead, hopping from onePR exercise to the next. He recalls the early days, when he waspersonally involved in everything. His assistant, Carina, reminds himthat he was running himself ragged before he mastered the art ofdelegating. Jerling replies that delegating can lead to peopleripping him off or revealing company secrets to the Hinchfigs(competitors). Moans that the Hinchfigs get bigger crowds at theiropenings, Carina points out that they pay the crowds more to turn up.
Jerling catches up ona few minor business matters. He reluctantly approves the recyclingof older company equipment (including several robots), then digsuntil Carina gives him something more interesting to think about. Hediscovers there's a freight job which is going wrong, and as the limodraws into the head office carpark Jerling decides to handle ithimself.
He examines theSeraph file. There's a shipment of robot parts ordered and paid for,but the source planet (Seraph IV) is in the middle of war games andthe massed ships of the Seraph Space Corps have already shot downthree unarmed freighters by mistake. The parts are needed urgently byJerling's assembly line, they're putting together a last-minute orderof robots for the Emperor's summer palace. Late delivery isn't anoption.
Carina explains thatthey can't risk their own ships, they wouldn't be covered byinsurance and anyway, none of their pilots will fly into the dangerzone. They tried to hire a freelancer but none of them wanted the jobeither - they were all warned off by a Spacers Guild bulletin.Jerling asks why they didn't try non-Guild pilots, Carina explainsthat they could only locate one and he turned it down because he wasconvinced it was a stolen goods racket. Jerling is annoyed that hisstaff hid the problem from him. Carina explains that they didn't wantto worry him. Jerling says they should have come to him before, thisis important, if they lose preferred supplier status his business isat risk, and worse still the Hinchfigs will gain on him.
Jerling asks Carinato call the idiot, the one who thought it was stolen goods. Beforethe assistant makes the call, she discovers that there's a messagefrom the 'idiot' already - he wants the job. Carina tries to pursuadeJerling that others can deal with the issue but Jerling's fired upand won't let go, it's his pet project.]]></Desc>

If Hal can take him, the pilot will return thefavour by landing Hal's ship when they arrive at the destination.
Hal says he doesn'tneed help, Jerling explains that the landing is at night, with noguidance. This makes Hal suspicious about the job again, but hedecides that nothing could be worse than another session with Brutus.Jerling reassures him that the pilot can handle everything andreminds him that delivery is to his premises on Forg. Hal agrees tothe job, starts to ask for an advance but Jerling disconnects.]]></Desc>

      <Desc><![CDATA[The Navcom tells Halsomeone is waiting outside the ship. Hal assumes it's the new pilotand goes to the airlock to admit them. Instead of a human, there's arobot outside, and for a moment Hal thinks Brutus has returned. Itisn't though, it's a run-down, obsolete robot with mismatched legsand a squashy, furrowed face. The geriatric robot smiles at Hal andexplains politely that it's Jerling's pilot.
Hal closes theairlock in its face, runs to the flight deck and calls Jerling. Heprotests that an old robot like that can't possibly land his valuableship. Jerling explains that the robot is an experienced pilot. Aftersome discussion, Hal accepts the situation. He goes back to theairlock, lets Clunk in but sends him to the cargo hold.
Hal prepares the shipfor takeoff, but ground control won't let him leave. The PortCommander wants to see him in person. Hal leaves the ship, puttingClunk in charge.]]></Desc>

      <BelongsToChID>5</BelongsToChID>
      <Desc><![CDATA[Hal leaves his shipvia the boarding ramp. (The Black Gull has two ramps - a large,heavy-duty cargo ramp which vehicles and robots use to load the ship,and a smaller boarding ramp which folds out from the side of the shipand admits visitors to the flight deck via an airlock.)
He has to get toground control, but they won't send a cab because of his unpaidaccount. He spots a robot mending fuel pipes near the back of theship and asks whether he can borrow its vehicle (A battered oldjet-powered ute). The robot refuses.
Hal decides to walkand sets off across the field towards the distant buildings, but thefield is covered in thick shoulder-high grasses with spore pods (Likeknotted pampas grass). After struggling heroically, Hal gives up andreturns in a bad temper. Approaching the landing pad again, he ducksdown in the grass and sneaks towards the maintenance robot's vehicle,intending to borrow it. He's about to clamber aboard when the robotsnaps something on the fuel pipes, causing a gushing leak. Hal ducksas the robot returns to the vehicle and grabs a tool kit.
While the robot isbusy mending the pipes, Hal leaps into the vehicle and starts it up.The robot spots him and pursues. The vehicle accelerates, but therobot manages to grab hold and swing itself aboard. Hal wiggles thejoystick and the wild movements throw the robot from side to side,battering it against the sides of the tray. One last violent twist ofthe controls hurls the robot from the back of the vehicle, and itcartwheels through the grass before coming to a halt in a sparking,smoking huddle.
Hal drives off,oblivious to the flames starting to flicker around the fallen robot.]]></Desc>

      <Desc><![CDATA[Aboard the BlackGull, Clunk is curious. He knows he's being sent to Incubots onSeraph IV, but nobody has told him why. He searches the Black Gull'soutdated computer for information on the company. (There's anequivalent to the internet called Galnet, but Hal can't afford thefees so his ship has a snapshot about 5 or 6 years old.) Clunkdiscovers that Incubots makes parts for new robots and replacementparts for older models. He's relieved, because Jerling's staff werevague about the reason for his trip, and it's fairly common forJerling's older, obsolete robots to be sent to out-of-the-wayplanets, never to return. Now it seems he's to be upgraded, which isgood news because he's got long list of worn parts which needreplacements.
Sitting at theconsole, Clunk uses the Black Gull's simulation mode to practice acouple of landings, then veers off and dreams he's flying the ship toa mythical robot planet.]]></Desc>

      <Desc><![CDATA[Hal is waiting inreception outside the Portmaster's office, browsing a magazine. Hereads an article about overclocked robot brains being used in newrobots, saving money but leading to risk of explosion. Hal wonders ifClunk is fitted with a defective brain - if any - and figures itwould be just his luck if Jerling's robot turned his ship into afiery wreck while he was sitting around waiting for petty officials.
The Portmasterinvites him into his office, and Hal discovers there are overduelanding fees, stamp duty, fuel, snacks, etc etc to pay for. The Portof Lamira is going to auction Hal's ship to recover debts. Halprotests that he has a job which will cover the fees, but thePortmaster doesn't believe him.
Hal decides to callhis brand new best buddy Clunk, thinking the robot can ask Jerlingfor an advance on his fee.]]></Desc>
