<P CLASS="western">(scene 1) Hal Spacejock was sitting at the Black
Gull's flight console, his attention riveted to a small chessboard
balanced amongst the toggle switches, flashing lights and status
displays. a few weeks earlier he'd read an article extolling the
benefits of the ancient game: how playing it would sharpen his mind,
improve his memory and increase his attraction to the opposite sex.
Chess had been an important part of his daily routine ever since, but
after two hundred and seventy-six losses in a row Hal was beginning
to doubt the article's claims. He didn't feel any smarter and he
couldn't remember the last time he'd spoken to a member of the
opposite sex, let alone had one attracted to him. Briefly, he
wondered whether it had been such a clever idea to play against the
Navcom, the Black Gull's onboard computer. Underpowered and outdated,
it was still more than capable of running the ship's accounts,
navigation and life support systems while beating humans at simple
board games. However, since Hal was the only human aboard the Black
Gull, his choice of opponents was limited.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Your turn,&quot; said
the Navcom, in a neutral female voice.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;I'm thinking.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;While you're planning
your opening move, can I tell you about a special offer?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;What kind of offer?&quot;
asked Hal suspiciously.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Planet books have a
chess title on sale.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Really? Put it on
main.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">The wide viewscreen above
the console turned red, and the word 'SaLE' appeared in vibrating
yellow text. The letters grew legs and marched off the screen,
bringing a wire basket on wheels into view.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;I don't need all this
crap,&quot; said Hal. &quot;Just show me the deal.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Almost there,&quot;
said the Navcom. &quot;Keep watching.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">A flock of pigeons burst
from the basket, leaving a tumbling cloud of feathers which dropped
to the ground and formed the words 'Special Offer'. a gust of wind
blew the feathers away, and a book title flashed up on the screen.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Chess for the
intellectually challenged?&quot; said Hal, staring at the cover in
disbelief. &quot;Is this some kind of joke?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;It's part of a
popular series,&quot; said the Navcom.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;What are the others?
Interstellar navigation for nutters? Moon landings for morons?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Shall I add those
titles to your basket?&quot;</P>

<P CLASS="western">(scene 2) On planet Forg, a small crowd had
gathered outside the local sky hockey stadium. South Forgberg was not
a prosperous area - the semi-detached houses were modest and the
residents faced a constant struggle to live within their means. It
was unusual to see building work or renovations, so the extensive
refurbishment to the decrepit old stadium had been a talking point
for months.</P>

<P CLASS="western">(scene 3) Hal was pacing the Black Gull's flight
deck, ready to put his fist through the nearest wall. &quot;What do
you mean, you can't call Jerling back? What do you mean you didn't
save his details?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;I erased the record
after you turned the job down.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;So look it up again!&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Negative, we can't
afford the search fees.&quot; The Navcom hesitated. &quot;Incidentally,
it's your move.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;How can you think of
a bloody chess game at a time like this?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;You're only saying
that because you're losing.&quot;</P>

<P CLASS="western">(scene 4) &quot;No sign of Jerling's pilot,&quot;
said Hal, who was standing in the Black Gull's airlock peering
through a scratched, yellowed porthole. He cupped his hands to the
plastic and squinted, but it made little difference. &quot;There
could be an army out there and I wouldn't know it.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Why don't you open
the door?&quot; asked the Navcom.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;No thanks. Vurdi's
robot might be hanging around.&quot;</P>

<P CLASS="western">(scene 5) Hal emerged from the Black Gull's
airlock, blinking in the sudden light. On the far side of the landing
field the sun was setting behind the Lamira spaceport's
administration block, which shimmered in the late afternoon heat.
Clustered around the spaceport buildings were the 'A' list - modern,
powerful ships fitted with every comfort. Parked close to the
amenities, their crews could dine at one of several restaurants,
enjoy the heated swimming pool and browse the shopping arcade at
their leisure.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Hal's ship was somewhat
further down the alphabet, and was therefore sitting in a disused
corner of the field about as far from the amenities as the nearest
moon. The area around the <EM CLASS="western">Black Gull</EM> was
little more than a graveyard for derelicts, and most of the landing
pads nearby were occupied by graffiti-splashed wrecks with jagged
gaps in their crumpled hulls. Some of the ships seemed familiar, and
when Hal looked closer he realised the rusted hulks were Rigel-class
freighters like his own. One or two were actually in better shape.</P>

<P CLASS="western">(scene 6) Clunk dropped the last chess piece into
the small wooden box and looked around the flight deck. Despite his
best efforts with the mop, it didn't look particularly clean, but
compared to its previous state it was as sterile as a hospital ward.
After a moment's hesitation, he sat in the pilot's chair. &quot;Navcom,
do you have a business directory?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Run a search, please.
All details on a company called Incubots.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">There was a brief pause.
&quot;Owned by Redge Muller. Incubots specialises in robot
programming and advanced pilot training.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Clunk looked relieved. &quot;So
that's what Mr. Jerling has in store for me. When I questioned him on
the subject he was rather evasive.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Humans tell lies
about the most trivial matters.&quot;</P>

<P CLASS="western">(scene 7) Hal left the maintenance vehicle in the
spaceport's outer carpark and walked to the admin block. An
information kiosk directed him to an elevator, where he pressed the
button marked 'Portmaster'.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Hal watched the floor
numbers changing as he dropped further and further underground. He'd
expected the Portmaster to have a spacious office with a view of the
whole landing field, but instead he seemed to have an office in the
basement. Below the basement, amended Hal, eying the elevator's
control panel. He'd passed that already.</P>

<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Clunk sat up straight.
&quot;Please open the connection.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Hey, robot!&quot;
called Hal.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Yes, sir?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Call Jerling and get
me a loan. I need three hundred in cash for landing fees and fuel.&quot;</P>

desk, eyes narrowed. &quot;Are you telling me this Jerling character
will pay your bill?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;He has to. I can't
deliver his cargo if the Gull is stuck here, can I?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">The commset buzzed and
Linten leant forward. &quot;Yes?&quot;</P>

<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Which pad?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Fifty-two,&quot; said
Hal, smothering a grin. &quot;That's Clunk.&quot; He leant towards
the commset. &quot;Clunk, is the ship in danger from this, er, fire?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Not yet, Mr
Spacejock, but it soon will be. Would you like me to move it out of
the way?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;You keep your hands
off the controls. I'll be there in a tick.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;You'll have to hurry,
the fire's right up to the refuelling cluster. If that explodes--&quot;</P>
