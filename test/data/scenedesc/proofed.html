		Spacejock is aboard his ship, the Black Gull, which is parked at
		the spaceport on planet Lamira. Hal's waiting for a cargo job, he's
		not fussy as long as it's legal. So far, after several days, the
		only jobs he's been offered have involved smuggling, gun-running or
		drugs.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Always short of money, Hal has arranged
		an interview with his financial backers in the hope of increasing
		his loan. There's a knock, but when Hal goes to let the loan people
		in he's confronted by a large robot which pins him to the deck.
		It's Brutus, an enforcer belonging to Vurdi the debt collector.
		Vurdi enters and explains that he's arrived to collect overdue
		payments on behalf of the loan company. Hal is confused, he thought
		they were supposed to be lending him money. Vurdi explains that it
		was a ploy to get aboard, since the company has had trouble getting
		face-to-face with Hal.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Hal doesn't have any money, so Vurdi
		says he'll take an arm or leg instead, and sets Brutus on him.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">During the scuffle, Hal manages to tell
		Vurdi that he accepted a cargo job earlier in the day, and will use
		the proceeds to settle his debts. Vurdi is suspicious, but calls
		Brutus off and gives Hal 24 hours.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">After Vurdi leaves, Hal discusses things
		with the Black Gull's onboard computer (the Navcom), reviewing the
		cargo jobs he's been offered. He chooses the one which sounds less
		risky than the others, a freight job offered by the Jerling
		corporation. The Navcom objects, reminding Hal that he turned it
		down earlier because he thought it involved stolen goods. Hal
		doesn't care - he can't afford to be choosy any more.</P>

		<P CLASS="firstlineindent"><A NAME="ScID:2"></A><!-- Jerling buys team. Discusses Seraph. -->Walter
		Jerling is a businessman on Forg, a planet in the same star system
		as Lamira. He owns several enterprises - real estate, factories,
		etc. We meet him at the grand opening of a new sky hockey stadium,
		puffing on his cigar and finishing off the ceremony without much
		enthusiasm. After a smattering of polite applause from the small
		crowd, he departs in his limo. 
		</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">In the car he complains that he's little
		more than a figurehead, hopping from one PR exercise to the next.
		He recalls the early days, when he was personally involved in
		everything. His assistant, Carina, reminds him that he was running
		himself ragged before he mastered the art of delegating. Jerling
		replies that delegating can lead to people ripping him off or
		revealing company secrets to the Hinchfigs (competitors). Moans
		that the Hinchfigs get bigger crowds at their openings, Carina
		points out that they pay the crowds more to turn up.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Jerling catches up on a few minor
		business matters. He reluctantly approves the recycling of older
		company equipment (including several robots), then digs until
		Carina gives him something more interesting to think about. He
		discovers there's a freight job which is going wrong, and as the
		limo draws into the head office carpark Jerling decides to handle
		it himself.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">He examines the Seraph file. There's a
		shipment of robot parts ordered and paid for, but the source planet
		(Seraph IV) is in the middle of war games and the massed ships of
		the Seraph Space Corps have already shot down three unarmed
		freighters by mistake. The parts are needed urgently by Jerling's
		assembly line, they're putting together a last-minute order of
		robots for the Emperor's summer palace. Late delivery isn't an
		option.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Carina explains that they can't risk
		their own ships, they wouldn't be covered by insurance and anyway,
		none of their pilots will fly into the danger zone. They tried to
		hire a freelancer but none of them wanted the job either - they
		were all warned off by a Spacers Guild bulletin. Jerling asks why
		they didn't try non-Guild pilots, Carina explains that they could
		only locate one and he turned it down because he was convinced it
		was a stolen goods racket. Jerling is annoyed that his staff hid
		the problem from him. Carina explains that they didn't want to
		worry him. Jerling says they should have come to him before, this
		is important, if they lose preferred supplier status his business
		is at risk, and worse still the Hinchfigs will gain on him.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Jerling asks Carina to call the idiot,
		the one who thought it was stolen goods. Before the assistant makes
		the call, she discovers that there's a message from the 'idiot'
		already - he wants the job. Carina tries to pursuade Jerling that
		others can deal with the issue but Jerling's fired up and won't let
		go, it's his pet project.</P>
	</DIV>
	<DIV ID="ScID:3" DIR="LTR">
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent"><A NAME="ScID:3"></A><!-- Hal takes a call from Jerling -->Back
		with Hal, Jerling's call comes through and the businessman explains
		about his cargo, reassures Hal it's not stolen goods, then explains
		he has a pilot at the Lamira Spaceport (the same location as Hal)
		who needs a lift to Seraph IV. If Hal can take him, the pilot will
		return the favour by landing Hal's ship when they arrive at the
		destination.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Hal says he doesn't need help, Jerling
		explains that the landing is at night, with no guidance. This makes
		Hal suspicious about the job again, but he decides that nothing
		could be worse than another session with Brutus. Jerling reassures
		him that the pilot can handle everything and reminds him that
		delivery is to his premises on Forg. Hal agrees to the job, starts
		to ask for an advance but Jerling disconnects.</P>

	<DIV ID="ScID:4" DIR="LTR">
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent"><A NAME="ScID:4"></A><!-- Clunk arrives -->The
		Navcom tells Hal someone is waiting outside the ship. Hal assumes
		it's the new pilot and goes to the airlock to admit them. Instead
		of a human, there's a robot outside, and for a moment Hal thinks
		Brutus has returned. It isn't though, it's a run-down, obsolete
		robot with mismatched legs and a squashy, furrowed face. The
		geriatric robot smiles at Hal and explains politely that it's
		Jerling's pilot.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Hal closes the airlock in its face, runs
		to the flight deck and calls Jerling. He protests that an old robot
		like that can't possibly land his valuable ship. Jerling explains
		that the robot is an experienced pilot. After some discussion, Hal
		accepts the situation. He goes back to the airlock, lets Clunk in
		but sends him to the cargo hold.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Hal prepares the ship for takeoff, but
		ground control won't let him leave. The Port Commander wants to see
		him in person. Hal leaves the ship, putting Clunk in charge.</P>
	</DIV>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="ChID:4" DIR="LTR">
	<H3>4</H3>
	<DIV ID="ScID:5" DIR="LTR">
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent"><A NAME="ScID:5"></A><!-- Hal going to port control -->Hal
		leaves his ship via the boarding ramp. (The Black Gull has two
		ramps - a large, heavy-duty cargo ramp which vehicles and robots
		use to load the ship, and a smaller boarding ramp which folds out
		from the side of the ship and admits visitors to the flight deck
		via an airlock.)</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">He has to get to ground control, but
		they won't send a cab because of his unpaid account. He spots a
		robot mending fuel pipes near the back of the ship and asks whether
		he can borrow its vehicle (A battered old jet-powered ute). The
		robot refuses.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Hal decides to walk and sets off across
		the field towards the distant buildings, but the field is covered
		in thick shoulder-high grasses with spore pods (Like knotted pampas
		grass). After struggling heroically, Hal gives up and returns in a
		bad temper. Approaching the landing pad again, he ducks down in the
		grass and sneaks towards the maintenance robot's vehicle, intending
		to borrow it. He's about to clamber aboard when the robot snaps
		something on the fuel pipes, causing a gushing leak. Hal ducks as
		the robot returns to the vehicle and grabs a tool kit.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">While the robot is busy mending the
		pipes, Hal leaps into the vehicle and starts it up. The robot spots
		him and pursues. The vehicle accelerates, but the robot manages to
		grab hold and swing itself aboard. Hal wiggles the joystick and the
		wild movements throw the robot from side to side, battering it
		against the sides of the tray. One last violent twist of the
		controls hurls the robot from the back of the vehicle, and it
		cartwheels through the grass before coming to a halt in a sparking,
		smoking huddle.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Hal drives off, oblivious to the flames
		starting to flicker around the fallen robot.</P>
	</DIV>
	<DIV ID="ScID:6" DIR="LTR">
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent"><A NAME="ScID:6"></A><!-- Clunk checking computer for Incubots. -->Aboard
		the Black Gull, Clunk is curious. He knows he's being sent to
		Incubots on Seraph IV, but nobody has told him why. He searches the
		Black Gull's outdated computer for information on the company.
		(There's an equivalent to the internet called Galnet, but Hal can't
		afford the fees so his ship has a snapshot about 5 or 6 years old.)
		Clunk discovers that Incubots makes parts for new robots and
		replacement parts for older models. He's relieved, because
		Jerling's staff were vague about the reason for his trip, and it's
		fairly common for Jerling's older, obsolete robots to be sent to
		out-of-the-way planets, never to return. Now it seems he's to be
		upgraded, which is good news because he's got long list of worn
		parts which need replacements.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Sitting at the console, Clunk uses the
		Black Gull's simulation mode to practice a couple of landings, then
		veers off and dreams he's flying the ship to a mythical robot
		planet.</P>
	</DIV>
	<DIV ID="ScID:7" DIR="LTR">
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent"><A NAME="ScID:7"></A><!-- Hal talking to the Portmaster -->Hal
		is waiting in reception outside the Portmaster's office, browsing a
		magazine. He reads an article about overclocked robot brains being
		used in new robots, saving money but leading to risk of explosion.
		Hal wonders if Clunk is fitted with a defective brain - if any -
		and figures it would be just his luck if Jerling's robot turned his
		ship into a fiery wreck while he was sitting around waiting for
		petty officials.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">The Portmaster invites him into his
		office, and Hal discovers there are overdue landing fees, stamp
		duty, fuel, snacks, etc etc to pay for. The Port of Lamira is going
		to auction Hal's ship to recover debts. Hal protests that he has a
		job which will cover the fees, but the Portmaster doesn't believe
		him.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Hal decides to call his brand new best
		buddy Clunk, thinking the robot can ask Jerling for an advance on
		his fee.</P>
	</DIV>
	<DIV ID="ScID:8" DIR="LTR">
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent"><A NAME="ScID:8"></A><!-- Clunk takes call from Hal. Calls Jerling. Fire. -->Clunk
		tells Hal that Jerling won't advance any money, but Hal tells him
		to ask anyway. Clunk calls Jerling, who won't advance any money.
		Clunk mentions that he's found out what Incubots is all about,
		Jerling hangs up quickly.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Clunk notices smoke in the air. He runs
		to the airlock and discovers the landing field is on fire.</P>

		is sitting with the Portmaster, waiting for a call from Clunk to
		say he's got the advance from Jerling. Instead, Clunk calls to say
		that raging flames are threatening the ship. Hal tells him to sit
		tight, and leaps up to go to the rescue. The Portmaster stops him -
		you're not fooling me, sonny, I've heard every excuse in the book.
		Hal protests, but the Portmaster is firm. He says the maintenance
		robot working near the Black Gull would have called in if anything
		was wrong.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Then the control tower calls to say the
		landing field is on fire around the Black Gull.</P>

	<DIV ID="ScID:10" DIR="LTR">
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent"><A NAME="ScID:10"></A><!-- Clunk fighting the fire, ends up face-down -->Aboard
		the Black Gull, Clunk wrenches panels off the walls looking for a
		fire extinguisher. Crunches the winch controls, lowering a hook to
		the ground and spooling all the cable out with it. Finally gets the
		extinguisher and heads outside.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">He finds the source of the fire - the
		maintenance robot which Hal disabled. Clunk drags it out of the
		area, then returns and uses the fire extinguisher on the flames.</P>
		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Clunk's battery starts to run low. He
		continues. As the fire extinguisher begins to run low, the fuel
		pipes explode near the back of the ship. A piece of debris hits

		departure, Hal was only supposed to move it out of danger, not

		Portmaster says he's going to spread the word about Hal, banning

		<P CLASS="firstlineindent">Talking to the Navcom, Hal suddenly
