	<P CLASS="western">At the center of the galaxy, a strange force is
	at work. Having already thrown thousands of stars out into the void,
	it is now attracting the attention of all the tabloids of the United
	Solar Systems. The government must take action. Elections are coming

	commander-in-chief (and only member): Rick Starlift, youngest cadet
	of the glorious Space Patrol. The ship: The Arcada, a hastily
	converted robot freighter. The mission: Get the problem out of the
	picture, keep the costs down and--under any circumstances--cause no

	being held hostage on board. The Space Patrol cruiser Armadillo is
	to find out the truth, taking the alien ship over. Member of the
	boarding party: Rick Starlift, officer candidate, who must not
	attract negative attention from his superior once again ...</P>
