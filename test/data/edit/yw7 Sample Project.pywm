		<P><!-- Meet Hal, threatened by Vurdi -->(You can download the
		complete text of Hal Spacejock, free, from

		<P><BR><BR>
		</P>
		<P>Hal Spacejock was sitting at the Black Gull&rsquo;s flight
		console, his attention riveted to a small chessboard balanced
		amongst the toggle switches, flashing lights and status displays. a
		few weeks earlier he&rsquo;d read an article extolling the benefits
		of the ancient game: how playing it would sharpen his mind, improve
		his memory and increase his attraction to the opposite sex. Chess
		had been an important part of his daily routine ever since, but
		after two hundred and seventy-six losses in a row Hal was beginning
		to doubt the article&rsquo;s claims. He didn&rsquo;t feel any
		smarter and he couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time he&rsquo;d
		spoken to a member of the opposite sex, let alone had one attracted
		to him. Briefly, he wondered whether it had been such a clever idea
		to play against the Navcom, the Black Gull&rsquo;s onboard
		computer. Underpowered and outdated, it was still more than capable
		of running the ship&rsquo;s accounts, navigation and life support
		systems while beating humans at simple board games. However, since
		Hal was the only human aboard the Black Gull, his choice of
		opponents was limited.</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Your turn,&rdquo; said the Navcom, in a neutral female
		voice.</P>
		<P>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re planning your opening move, can I tell
		you about a special offer?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;What kind of offer?&rdquo; asked Hal suspiciously.</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Planet books have a chess title on sale.&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Really? Put it on main.&rdquo;</P>
		<P>The wide viewscreen above the console turned red, and the word
		&lsquo;SaLE&rsquo; appeared in vibrating yellow text. The letters
		grew legs and marched off the screen, bringing a wire basket on
		wheels into view.</P>
		<P>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need all this crap,&rdquo; said Hal. &ldquo;Just
		show me the deal.&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Almost there,&rdquo; said the Navcom. &ldquo;Keep
		watching.&rdquo;</P>
		<P>A flock of pigeons burst from the basket, leaving a tumbling
		cloud of feathers which dropped to the ground and formed the words
		&lsquo;Special Offer&rsquo;. a gust of wind blew the feathers away,
		and a book title flashed up on the screen.</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Chess for the intellectually challenged?&rdquo; said Hal,
		staring at the cover in disbelief. &ldquo;Is this some kind of
		joke?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of a popular series,&rdquo; said the
		Navcom.</P>
		<P>&ldquo;What are the others? Interstellar navigation for nutters?
		Moon landings for morons?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Shall I add those titles to your basket?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>. . .</P>

		<P><!-- Jerling buys team. Discusses Seraph. -->On planet Forg, a
		small crowd had gathered outside the local sky hockey stadium.
		South Forgberg was not a prosperous area - the semi-detached houses
		were modest and the residents faced a constant struggle to live
		within their means. It was unusual to see building work or
		renovations, so the extensive refurbishment to the decrepit old
		stadium had been a talking point for months.</P>

		<P><!-- Hal takes a call from Jerling -->Hal was pacing the Black

		wall. &ldquo;What do you mean, you can&rsquo;t call Jerling back?
		What do you mean you didn&rsquo;t save his details?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;I erased the record after you turned the job down.&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;So look it up again!&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Negative, we can&rsquo;t afford the search fees.&rdquo;
		The Navcom hesitated. &ldquo;Incidentally, it&rsquo;s your move.&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;How can you think of a bloody chess game at a time like
		this?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only saying that because you&rsquo;re

		<P><!-- Clunk arrives -->&ldquo;No sign of Jerling&rsquo;s pilot,&rdquo;
		said Hal, who was standing in the Black Gull&rsquo;s airlock
		peering through a scratched, yellowed porthole. He cupped his hands
		to the plastic and squinted, but it made little difference. &ldquo;There
		could be an army out there and I wouldn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you open the door?&rdquo; asked the
		Navcom.</P>

		<P><!-- Hal going to port control -->Hal emerged from the Black
		Gull&rsquo;s airlock, blinking in the sudden light. On the far side
		of the landing field the sun was setting behind the Lamira
		spaceport&rsquo;s administration block, which shimmered in the late
		afternoon heat. Clustered around the spaceport buildings were the
		&lsquo;A&rsquo; list - modern, powerful ships fitted with every
		comfort. Parked close to the amenities, their crews could dine at
		one of several restaurants, enjoy the heated swimming pool and
		browse the shopping arcade at their leisure.</P>
		<P>Hal&rsquo;s ship was somewhat further down the alphabet, and was
		therefore sitting in a disused corner of the field about as far
		from the amenities as the nearest moon. The area around the <I>Black
		Gull</I> was little more than a graveyard for derelicts, and most
		of the landing pads nearby were occupied by graffiti-splashed
		wrecks with jagged gaps in their crumpled hulls. Some of the ships
		seemed familiar, and when Hal looked closer he realised the rusted
		hulks were Rigel-class freighters like his own. One or two were
		actually in better shape.</P>

		<P><!-- Clunk checking computer for Incubots. -->Clunk dropped the
		last chess piece into the small wooden box and looked around the
		flight deck. Despite his best efforts with the mop, it didn&rsquo;t
		look particularly clean, but compared to its previous state it was
		as sterile as a hospital ward. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
		he sat in the pilot&rsquo;s chair. &ldquo;Navcom, do you have a
		business directory?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Run a search, please. All details on a company called
		Incubots.&rdquo;</P>
		<P>There was a brief pause. &ldquo;Owned by Redge Muller. Incubots
		specialises in robot programming and advanced pilot training.&rdquo;</P>
		<P>Clunk looked relieved. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what Mr. Jerling
		has in store for me. When I questioned him on the subject he was
		rather evasive.&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Humans tell lies about the most trivial matters.&rdquo;</P>

		<P><!-- Hal talking to the Portmaster -->Hal left the maintenance
		vehicle in the spaceport&rsquo;s outer carpark and walked to the
		admin block. An information kiosk directed him to an elevator,
		where he pressed the button marked &lsquo;Portmaster&rsquo;.</P>
		<P>Hal watched the floor numbers changing as he dropped further and
		further underground. He&rsquo;d expected the Portmaster to have a
		spacious office with a view of the whole landing field, but instead
		he seemed to have an office in the basement. Below the basement,
		amended Hal, eying the elevator&rsquo;s control panel. He&rsquo;d

		<P>&ldquo;Are we meant to answer it?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Spacejock,&rdquo; said the Navcom.</P>

		<P>&ldquo;Hey, robot!&rdquo; called Hal.</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo;</P>

		<P>&ldquo;He has to. I can&rsquo;t deliver his cargo if the Gull is
		stuck here, can I?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>The commset buzzed and Linten leant forward. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>There was a crackling sound. &ldquo;Help! Fire!&rdquo; said a
		voice over the noise.</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Who is this? What are you talking about?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;The grass is burning,&rdquo; cried the voice. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s

		<P>&ldquo;Which pad?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Fifty-two,&rdquo; said Hal, smothering a grin. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s

		ship in danger from this, er, fire?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;Not yet, Mr Spacejock, but it soon will be. Would you
		like me to move it out of the way?&rdquo;</P>
		<P>&ldquo;You keep your hands off the controls. I&rsquo;ll be there
