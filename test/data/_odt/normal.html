<P CLASS="western"><!-- - Meet Hal, threatened by Vurdi -->Hal
Spacejock was sitting at the Black Gull's flight console, his
attention riveted to a small chessboard balanced amongst the toggle
switches, flashing lights and status displays. a few weeks earlier
he'd read an article extolling the benefits of the ancient game: how
playing it would sharpen his mind, improve his memory and increase
his attraction to the opposite sex. Chess had been an important part
of his daily routine ever since, but after two hundred and
seventy-six losses in a row Hal was beginning to doubt the article's
claims. He didn't feel any smarter and he couldn't remember the last
time he'd spoken to a member of the opposite sex, let alone had one
attracted to him. Briefly, he wondered whether it had been such a
clever idea to play against the Navcom, the Black Gull's onboard
computer. Underpowered and outdated, it was still more than capable
of running the ship's accounts, navigation and life support systems
while beating humans at simple board games. However, since Hal was
the only human aboard the Black Gull, his choice of opponents was
limited.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Your turn,&quot; said
the Navcom, in a neutral female voice.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;I'm thinking.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;While you're planning
your opening move, can I tell you about a special offer?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;What kind of offer?&quot;
asked Hal suspiciously.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Planet books have a
chess title on sale.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Really? Put it on
main.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">The wide viewscreen above
the console turned red, and the word 'SaLE' appeared in vibrating
yellow text. <!-- this is the author's first note  -->The letters
grew legs and marched off the screen, bringing a wire basket on
wheels into view.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;I don't need all this
crap,&quot; said Hal. &quot;Just show me the deal.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Almost there,&quot;
said the Navcom. &quot;Keep watching.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">A flock of pigeons burst
from the basket, leaving a tumbling cloud of feathers which dropped
to the ground and formed the words 'Special Offer'. a gust of wind
blew the feathers away, and a book title flashed up on the screen.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Chess for the
intellectually challenged?&quot; said Hal, staring at the cover in
disbelief. &quot;Is this some kind of joke?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;It's part of a
popular series,&quot; said the Navcom.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;What are the others?
Interstellar navigation for nutters? Moon landings for morons?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Shall I add those
titles to your basket?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western"><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><!-- - Jerling buys team. Discusses Seraph. -->On
planet Forg, a small crowd had gathered outside the local sky hockey
stadium. South Forgberg was not a prosperous area - the semi-detached
houses were modest and the residents faced a constant struggle to
live within their means. It was unusual to see building work or
renovations, so the extensive refurbishment to the decrepit old
stadium had been a talking point for months.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">. . .</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><!-- - Hal takes a call from Jerling -->Hal was
pacing the Black Gull's flight deck, ready to put his fist through
the nearest wall. &quot;What do you mean, you can't call Jerling
back? What do you mean you didn't save his details?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;I erased the record
after you turned the job down.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;So look it up again!&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Negative, we can't
afford the search fees.&quot; The Navcom hesitated. &quot;Incidentally,
it's your move.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;How can you think of
a bloody chess game at a time like this?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;You're only saying
that because you're losing.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">. . .</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Chapter 3</H2>
<P CLASS="western"><!-- - Clunk arrives -->&quot;No sign of Jerling's
pilot,&quot; said Hal, who was standing in the Black Gull's airlock
peering through a scratched, yellowed porthole. He cupped his hands
to the plastic and squinted, but it made little difference. &quot;There
could be an army out there and I wouldn't know it.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Why don't you open
the door?&quot; asked the Navcom.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;No thanks. Vurdi's
robot might be hanging around.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">. . .</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Chapter 4</H2>
<P CLASS="western"><!-- - Hal going to port control -->Hal emerged
from the Black Gull's airlock, blinking in the sudden light. On the
far side of the landing field the sun was setting behind the Lamira
spaceport's administration block, which shimmered in the late
afternoon heat. Clustered around the spaceport buildings were the 'A'
list - modern, powerful ships fitted with every comfort. Parked close
to the amenities, their crews could dine at one of several
restaurants, enjoy the heated swimming pool and browse the shopping
arcade at their leisure.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Hal's ship was somewhat
further down the alphabet, and was therefore sitting in a disused
corner of the field about as far from the amenities as the nearest
moon. The area around the <EM CLASS="western">Black Gull</EM> was
little more than a graveyard for derelicts, and most of the landing
pads nearby were occupied by graffiti-splashed wrecks with jagged
gaps in their crumpled hulls. Some of the ships seemed familiar, and
when Hal looked closer he realised the rusted hulks were Rigel-class
freighters like his own. One or two were actually in better shape.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western"><BR>

<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">. . .</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><!-- - Clunk checking computer for Incubots. -->Clunk
dropped the last chess piece into the small wooden box and looked
around the flight deck. Despite his best efforts with the mop, it
didn't look particularly clean, but compared to its previous state it
was as sterile as a hospital ward. After a moment's hesitation, he
sat in the pilot's chair. &quot;Navcom, do you have a business
directory?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Run a search, please.
All details on a company called Incubots.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">There was a brief pause.
&quot;Owned by Redge Muller. Incubots specialises in robot
programming and advanced pilot training.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Clunk looked relieved. &quot;So
that's what Mr. Jerling has in store for me. When I questioned him on
the subject he was rather evasive.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Humans tell lies
about the most trivial matters.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western"><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><!-- - Hal talking to the Portmaster -->Hal left
the maintenance vehicle in the spaceport's outer carpark and walked
to the admin block. An information kiosk directed him to an elevator,
where he pressed the button marked 'Portmaster'.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Hal watched the floor
numbers changing as he dropped further and further underground. He'd
expected the Portmaster to have a spacious office with a view of the
whole landing field, but instead he seemed to have an office in the
basement. Below the basement, amended Hal, eying the elevator's
control panel. He'd passed that already.</P>

<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Are we meant to
answer it?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;It's Mr. Spacejock,&quot;
said the Navcom.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">Clunk sat up straight.
&quot;Please open the connection.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Hey, robot!&quot;
called Hal.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Yes, sir?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Call Jerling and get
me a loan. I need three hundred in cash for landing fees and fuel.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;I don't think he'll
lend you any money,&quot; said Clunk dubiously.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">. . .</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Chapter 5</H2>
<P CLASS="western"><!-- - Clunk calls, the landing field is on fire. Hal tells him to sit tight. -->Portmaster
Linten studied Hal across the desk, eyes narrowed. &quot;Are you
telling me this Jerling character will pay your bill?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;He has to. I can't
deliver his cargo if the Gull is stuck here, can I?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">The commset buzzed and
Linten leant forward. &quot;Yes?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">There was a crackling
sound. &quot;Help! Fire!&quot; said a voice over the noise.</P>

you talking about?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;The grass is
burning,&quot; cried the voice. <!-- the author's second note ... -->
&quot;There's a fire on the landing field!&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Which pad?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Fifty-two,&quot; said
Hal, smothering a grin. &quot;That's Clunk.&quot; He leant towards
the commset. &quot;Clunk, is the ship in danger from this, er, fire?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Not yet, Mr
Spacejock, but it soon will be. Would you like me to move it out of
the way?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;You keep your hands
off the controls. I'll be there in a tick.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;You'll have to hurry,
the fire's right up to the refuelling cluster. If that explodes--&quot;</P>

fire hose!&quot; shouted Clunk.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;Deploying.&quot;
There was a whining sound outside the hull, which stopped with a
sharp crack.</P>
<P CLASS="textk&ouml;rper-einzug-western">&quot;What was that?&quot;</P>
