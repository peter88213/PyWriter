# PyWriter: Read, write, and process yWriter 7 files with Python

[yWriter 7](http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter7.html) is a free word processor whose strengths are structuring novels and controlling the progress during the writing process. The PyWriter library provides Python classes to read and write yWriter 7 projects and convert the project data to and from several file formats such as odt, ods, csv, and html.

For more information, see the [Project home page](https://peter88213.github.io/PyWriter/)

## Applications

The PyWriter project started with a library for yWriter7 file operations such as export and import scenes. Based on this library, there now are several, supporting the novelist's work with yWriter in combination with a powerful Office suite.
