# PyWriter: Read, write, and process yWriter 7 files with Python

[yWriter 7](http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter7.html) is a free word processor whose strengths are structuring novels and controlling the progress during the writing process. The PyWriter library provides Python classes to read and write yWriter 7 projects and convert the project data to and from several file formats such as odt, ods, csv, and html.

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org) version 3.6+.

## Applications

Based on the  _pywriter_  library, there now are several applications, supporting the novelist's work with yWriter in combination with a powerful Office suite.
