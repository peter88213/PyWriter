# PyWriter: Read, write, and process yWriter 7 files with Python

[yWriter 7](http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter7.html) is a free word processor whose strengths are structuring novels and controlling the progress during the writing process. Although a very fine and useful app, yWriter 7 lacks a really working  _scenes export and import for proof reading_  capability as known from yWriter 5.



The PyWriter project started with a library for yWriter7 file operations such as export and import scenes. Based on this library, there are several applications to come, supporting the novelist's work with yWriter. Basically, it is for my own use, but feel free to try the programs and give me feedback in the yWriter discussion group. 

    

## Applications: 

### yw_proof_docx

[Using DOCX for proofreading](https://github.com/peter88213/PyWriter/wiki/Using-DOCX-for-proofreading)

### yw_proof_odt

[Using ODT for proofreading](https://github.com/peter88213/PyWriter/wiki/Using-ODT-for-proofreading)

### yw_export_html

(to come ...)
