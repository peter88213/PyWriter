# PyWriter: Read, write, and process yWriter 7 files with Python

[yWriter 7](http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter7.html) is a free word processor whose strengths are structuring novels and controlling the progress during the writing process. The PyWriter library provides Python classes to read and write yWriter 7 projects and convert the project data to and from several file formats such as odt, ods, csv, and html.

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org) version 3.6+.

## Applications

Based on the  _pywriter_  library, there now are several applications, supporting the novelist's work with yWriter in combination with a powerful Office suite.

## Development

*PyWriter* is organized as an Eclipse PyDev project. The official release branch on GitHub is *main*.

### Conventions

- Minimum Python version is 3.6. 
- The Python **source code formatting** follows widely the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide, except the maximum line length, which is 120 characters here.
- The **code commenting** follows the [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257) convention. [pydoc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html) can be used to display documentation for the *pywriter* modules and classes.

### Development tools

- [Python](https://python.org) version 3.9
- [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org) with [PyDev](https://pydev.org) and [EGit](https://www.eclipse.org/egit/)
- [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) for building application scripts

### Documentation tools

- [Eclipse Papyrus](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/) Modeling environment for creating Use Case and Class diagrams
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) for creating Sequence diagrams
