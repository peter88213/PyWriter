# PyWriter: Read, write, and process yWriter 7 files with Python

[yWriter 7](http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter7.html) is a free word processor whose strengths are structuring novels and controlling the progress during the writing process. Although a very fine and useful app, yWriter 7 lacks a really working  _scenes export and import for proof reading_  capability as known from yWriter 5.



The PyWriter project started with a library for yWriter7 file operations such as export and import scenes. Based on this library, there are several applications to come, supporting the novelist's work with yWriter in combination with a powerful Office suite.
